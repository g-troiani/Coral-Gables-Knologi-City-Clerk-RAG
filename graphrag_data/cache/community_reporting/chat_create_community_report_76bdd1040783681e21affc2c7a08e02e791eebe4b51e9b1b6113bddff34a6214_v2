Planning and Zoning is a governing body responsible for reviewing development projects under the Live Local Act. The Conditional Use Process applies to larger properties over 20,000 square feet and involves multiple review bodies including Planning and Zoning, the Development Review Committee, Board of Architects, and City Commission. The Building Peer Review Process is a component of the Conditional Use Process specifically for these larger properties. Development refers to construction projects subject to these zoning and review regulations, with distinct processes depending on property size.

It holds a degree of 3, indicating its moderate connectivity within the community. Its role is critical in ensuring that development projects comply with zoning regulations and local policies. Planning and Zoning's involvement in the Conditional Use Process highlights its authority in overseeing developments, particularly those exceeding 20,000 square feet, which require more rigorous review. This central position underscores its influence on shaping the urban landscape and enforcing compliance with city planning standards [Data: Entities (829); Relationships (1197)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Conditional Use Process governs large property developments\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Conditional Use Process applies specifically to properties greater than 20,000 square feet in Coral Gables. It mandates review by multiple bodies including the Development Review Committee, Board of Architects, Planning and Zoning, and the City Commission. This process ensures that larger developments meet comprehensive standards related to zoning, land use, and community impact. With a high degree of 6, the Conditional Use Process is highly connected and integral to the community's regulatory framework. It acts as a gatekeeper for significant development projects, requiring adherence to the Live Local Act and other local regulations.

It involves multiple review bodies but is not required for smaller properties under the Live Local Act. This process provides an additional layer of technical scrutiny to ensure that building designs and plans meet safety, architectural, and zoning standards. With a degree of 2, it is less connected than the Conditional Use Process but remains essential for larger developments.

Developments over 20,000 square feet must undergo the Conditional Use Process and the Building Peer Review Process, while smaller projects follow different procedures under the Live Local Act. This distinction ensures that larger projects receive more comprehensive oversight due to their potential impact on the community.

This layered approach ensures that developments comply with multiple standards and receive scrutiny from various expert bodies, reducing risks related to non-compliance and poor planning.
