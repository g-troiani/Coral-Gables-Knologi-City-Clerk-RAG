Back in 2001 through 2003,  St. Philip' s underwent a master plan process.   And in that process,  it was proposing a new building,  but during that process,  it underwent a total review of its operations.   Conditions were imposed,  limiting the number of students,  setting up the drop-off operation,  legislating certain landscaping,  making sure that any changes to a site plan would go before a public hearing process, making decisions with respect to colors of the building so that the school would blend into the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential neighborhood,  parking for employees in the lot to the east of Salvadore Park,  and also dealing with special event permits for the special events that were held either by the school or by the church.   Again, to put it into a geographic location,  the school is located immediately north of Salvadore Park that as you know has a whole playground section,  tennis courts, a pickleball court, the little parking lot to the east and a dog park now. The request that we are making today is to demolish an existing building that sits at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia and replace it with another building.   The idea is -- well, the reason for it is the building was old, had sagging floors and had a lot of issues and it made more sense to demolish the building and build a new one.   The new structure will be approximately the same size.   It will house the same two classrooms,  Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, a multi-purpose room and storage area.  The difference in the square footage is that there is now a covered walkway that is a canopy and it's an awning and that,  for security purposes,  will be enclosed and it will connect to another building on the campus.   Let' s see,  the Board of Architects has approved the new building. We went twice to the Board of Architects.   They wanted windows on the eastern side of the new building.   One of the conditions that was imposed in the 2001-2003 master plan would be that no building would have any windows on the eastern side.  Board of Architects insisted that it would look too institutional,  which is what we were trying to avoid,  and so they asked that we change that condition and the windows are fixed and operable windows.   They' re meant for an aesthetic purpose,  not to function.   They are actually on the portion of the building that' s closest to the front, which is adjacent to the driveway and garage of the adjacent neighbor to the east of us.   The balance of the building,  which is in back,  which would face the single- family neighbor to the right is solid and there' s extensive landscaping that' s several feet wide that was put in back in 2003 as part of the condition for the original site plan. We appeared before the Planning and Zoning Board. Staff recommended approval with three conditions,  that the windows remain fixed and inoperative,  that we keep every other condition,  including the limitation on the number of children,  and that we heavily landscape the front part of this building.  During COVID, the front part of this building was graveled in order to facilitate the drop-off when we first started going back to school.  And so it has remained gravel. That gravel will be removed after construction and that area in front of this will be heavily landscaped.   So, right now the drop-off is set up.  There is a drop-off for the older grades.   Third, fourth,  and fifth grade are dropped off in front of the school.   Four parking spaces are coned off and the parents come in going east to west so that the children can be dropped off on the sidewalk side and not on the street side.   And a neighbor that -who is here as well has appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and an additional condition was added to the approval. And the condition was that the church landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia. And so we' re here to respectfully request that we keep the conditions that were imposed by staff and eliminate that condition and I'd like to explain why.   First of all, those are not adjacent neighbors.   Those four properties,  one of them happens to belong to the church,  the one on the corner of --  the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova belongs to St. Philip' s. The other three are not adjacent, meaning they don' t abut the school property. We are not proposing an increase in students,  so we are not making a bigger impact.   The same number of students,  180, have gone to this school since 2001.  We are in an area where the increased activity and need for parking has come from the beautiful playground equipment that now adorns\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nSalvadore Park.   Having used it as a mother,  it's a vast improvement from what it was 30-some years ago.   There is also,  as you know, very active use of the tennis courts,  starting from early in the morning now that one of the courts has been designated a pickleball court,  one of the most popular sports in in the country.   And you also now have a dog park.  So, it is a neighborhood that has a lot of activity.   The school is there 172 days out of 365.
