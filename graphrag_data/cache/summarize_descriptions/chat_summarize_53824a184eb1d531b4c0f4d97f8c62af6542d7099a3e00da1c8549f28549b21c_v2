Working alongside the City of Coral Gables and the Historic Preservation Board, the Board of Architects helps standardize elements such as streetlights to maintain the city's aesthetic and historical integrity. It is actively involved in reviewing and approving building designs and demolitions, as mandated by the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants and other regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe Board participates in the review process for various development projects, including those impacted by the Live Local Act, ensuring compliance with local regulations and community standards. For example, it reviewed and approved the new building design for St. Philip's School, requiring the inclusion of windows on the eastern side of the building for aesthetic reasons, despite a prior master plan condition that prohibited windows on that side. This decision followed multiple reviews and consultations, including Design Review Committee (DRC) evaluations and neighborhood meetings, demonstrating the Board’s thorough and collaborative approach.\n\nAdditionally, the Board of Architects may require public hearings and notices as specified in the public notice table, ensuring transparency and community involvement in its decision-making processes. Overall, the Board serves as a key entity in shaping Coral Gables’ architectural landscape by balancing regulatory compliance, aesthetic considerations, and community input.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762928, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 257, "prompt_tokens": 356, "total_tokens": 613, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
