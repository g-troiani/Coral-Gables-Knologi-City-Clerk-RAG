These hearings are preceded by a public notice published in a newspaper of general circulation, with the notice period ranging from at least ten to fifteen days prior to the hearing date, depending on the specific matter under consideration. In addition to the published notice, courtesy notices are often mailed to nearby or riparian property owners within 1,000 feet of the affected property or proposed work site, ensuring that those directly impacted are informed. The public hearing process typically follows an investigation and recommendation by relevant city officials, such as the director of the public works department, particularly when permit applications are involved. During the hearing, all users and interested parties are given the opportunity to be heard, allowing for public input before the City Commission makes a final decision. This process ensures transparency, community involvement, and informed decision-making in matters affecting city infrastructure and services.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749842377, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 228, "prompt_tokens": 342, "total_tokens": 570, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
