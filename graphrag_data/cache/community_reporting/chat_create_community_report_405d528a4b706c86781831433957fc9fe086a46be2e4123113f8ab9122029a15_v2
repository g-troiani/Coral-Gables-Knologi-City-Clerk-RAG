The ordinance introduces significant changes including exemptions for various city facilities from zoning procedures, the authorization of a Development Review Official to approve minor changes, and a shift to online notifications supported by an education campaign.

These facilities include public parks, playgrounds, fire stations, police stations, public libraries, water and sewer treatment plants, public buildings, auditoriums, museums, solid waste facilities, maintenance yards, bus stations, and other governmental uses as determined by the City Commission. This broad exemption streamlines administrative processes for essential public infrastructure, potentially accelerating development and maintenance activities while reducing bureaucratic delays.
