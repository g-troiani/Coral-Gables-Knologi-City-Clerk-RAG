One common use of an affidavit is as a proof of posting, where the person posting a notice submits a sworn statement that includes a copy of the notice, the date it was posted, and the specific locations where the notice was displayed. This affidavit serves as official evidence that the notice was properly posted according to required procedures. Additionally, affidavits are used annually by schools to report student enrollment numbers. In this context, the affidavit acts as a legally binding agreement that helps enforce enrollment limitations, ensuring that schools comply with regulatory requirements regarding the number of students enrolled.
