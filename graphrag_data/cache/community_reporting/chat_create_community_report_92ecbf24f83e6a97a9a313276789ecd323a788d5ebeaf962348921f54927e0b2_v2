Suarez.\n\nA key provision of the ordinance updates the publication requirements for legal notices. It allows for the publication of such notices on a publicly accessible website, reflecting both cost savings and compliance with Florida Statutes. Despite this modernization, the ordinance maintains the requirement for publication of notice within 30 days in a newspaper of general circulation, recording in public records, and filing a certified copy in the county public records. The costs associated with these notices are borne by the applicant, ensuring that the city does not incur additional expenses.\n\nThe ordinance also integrates changes into the City of Coral Gables Zoning Code, including amendments to sections, articles, and reference portions such as the Table of Contents, to fully incorporate the ordinance’s intentions. These changes become effective immediately upon passage and adoption.\n\nIn addition to procedural and publication updates, the ordinance defines specific criteria for parking reductions. As discussed by Planning Official Garcia, these criteria include requirements for accessible routes to major transit stops, sidewalks, ramps, and crosswalks. Notably, the ordinance clarifies that if bus stops are eliminated, no amendment to the parking reduction criteria is necessary, providing flexibility in transit-related planning.\n\nFurthermore, the ordinance addresses signage regulations within the City, particularly focusing on sign pollution and compliance issues in the Central Business District. This aspect of the ordinance has been a subject of community and Commission discussion and is linked to ongoing enforcement efforts aimed at maintaining aesthetic and regulatory standards in the city’s commercial core.\n\nLastly, the ordinance includes provisions granting applications for abandonment, requiring that certified copies of such approvals be filed in the county public records. Similar to other notice requirements, the costs for these notices are the responsibility of the applicant.\n\nOverall, this ordinance represents a multifaceted update to the City of Coral Gables’ regulatory framework, enhancing transparency, modernizing legal notice procedures, refining parking and signage regulations, and ensuring proper documentation and cost allocation for applications processed by the City Commission.\",20\n174,SECTION 62-331,\"Section 62-331, titled \"\"Adoption of Ordinance,\"\" outlines the procedures followed by the City Commission for adopting ordinances.
