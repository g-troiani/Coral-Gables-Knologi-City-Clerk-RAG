Since 1980, the board has played a key role in identifying and standardizing streetlight types in Coral Gables, working collaboratively with the City of Coral Gables, the Landmarks Advisory Board, city staff, and other advisors to research and recommend a city standard for streetlighting. Beyond streetlight preservation, the Historic Preservation Board oversees the protection of historic properties by considering requests for Special Certificates of Appropriateness. These certificates are required for certain actions affecting historic properties and involve a formal process that includes public notice and posting at least ten days prior to public hearings. The board is authorized to grant Special Certificates of Appropriateness for relocating significant historic improvements when preservation at the original site is not feasible. Such relocations are permitted only if the new site is compatible with the historic and architectural integrity of the improvement, ensuring that the preservation goals of the city are upheld. Through these responsibilities, the Historic Preservation Board serves as a vital entity in maintaining the cultural and architectural heritage of Coral Gables.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749842374, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 576, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
