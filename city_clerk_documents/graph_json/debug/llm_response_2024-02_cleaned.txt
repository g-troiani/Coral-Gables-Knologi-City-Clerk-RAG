Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user said it can be anywhere, so I have to check the entire text. Let me start skimming through the provided text.

Looking at the beginning, the document is Ordinance No. 2024-02. The main body talks about amending various sections. The WHEREAS clauses and sections 1 to 7 don't mention an agenda item. 

Moving to the end sections. Near the end, after the sections like Sec. 109-42, there's a part after all the sections. Let me check the very end. 

Looking for keywords like "Agenda item" or similar. Scanning through the last pages, in the section where the ordinance was passed, there's a line: 

"PASSED ANDADOPTED THISNINTHDAYOFJANUARY, A.D., 2024. 
Moved: Anderson / Seconded: Fernandez) 
Yeas: Anderson, Castro, Fernandez, Menendez, Lago) 
Unanimous: 5-0Vote) 
AgendaItem: E-2) 
APPROVED: 
VINCELAGO
MAYOR
..."

Ah, there it is. The line says "AgendaItem: E-2)". The code is E-2. I need to make sure there's no other instances, but this seems to be the only one. The format matches the examples given, like "Agenda Item: E-2" would be E-2. Here it's written as "AgendaItem: E-2" but the code is E-2. So the answer should be E-2.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-2
