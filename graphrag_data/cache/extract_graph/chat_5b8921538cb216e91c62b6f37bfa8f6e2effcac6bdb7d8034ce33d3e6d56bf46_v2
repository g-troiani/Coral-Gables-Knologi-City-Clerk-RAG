Gables, identify all entities and their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

I'm going to show you in just a few minutes almost a dozen.  The City Commission received a report and then discussed,  and I can' t find an action item where they actually adopted it but sought to standardize the streetlights in 1980 and begin working diligently with not only the Historic Preservation Board,  and the Board of Architects and other advisors,  but with the Florida Power and Light Company and Public Works Department.  After a while, about a year, it was an Arcadian fixture, which you can see right here, was selected and it's actually in the catalog of this company and it's called a Coral Gables Light Fixture, and this is the one that' s been in use really since that time. So, they provided this to FPL, told FPL and FPL came back and said the following,  company owned fixtures will normally be mounted on poles of the company' s existing distribution system and serve from overhead wires on request by the customer, of the customer,  the company will provide special poles and underground wires that charges specified below. In other words, this is their rate base.  We all know that FPL has a rate base.  They\n\nhave to go to the Public Service Commission.  They have to take everything that everybody asks them for and then have it approved,  and what we' re asking for is to come back and take a look at that. In 1986 FPL purchased these lights and installed them for us. We don' t have the capability to do it. They first went in on Segovia.  They are still there.  They look great,  haven' t been taken out. And so, this is what we have. The light I'm showing you right now though isn' t on Segovia,  but it' s exactly like the one there. This is over by the Douglas Entrance,  and it was just installed;  and if you look at the ground plan, you' ll see that there' s a new base and there' s the markings out for the new wire. So, they put this in and yet, they are taking out poles exactly like this and putting in black poles which are really not appropriate and haven' t been here.  If you would please.  Thank you.  Being a guy that' s been involved in cities for over 45 years,  I have to have a map,  and so I went around town and the red lines that you see on the map that' s where the silver standard White Way Lights are. Now they are intermixed with some of the Denman Fink lights and I'm thrilled to have those back. That' s just the best thing. I've been advocating that for years.  And Mayor and all of you here on the Commission,  I really applaud your efforts for this. It's so unique and I hope that we take advantage of that and continue to use those lights in even more special places,  but the whole idea here about this is to say look, we have a lot of these things already.  Let' s not change them,  let' s re-enforce it. Let' s also look at and see what we can do to, if you would please go to the next one, to change these streetlights,  because these are the most common streetlights that we have in Coral Gables.  The wood pole that you can see.  The one mounted on a concrete pole or the… concrete pole. Show the next one please. And then we have other streetlights.  And these other streetlights are generally with the exception of the one in the middle,  and that also happens there too,  are generally a private development,  but they are on city right-of-way.  Why doesn' t the city say hey, we' ve got a brand here, use our streetlights.  You get to put it in, you get to pay for it, but please use ours,  and you can use our great Denman Fink lights if you wish.  Go to the next one please.  We have the one in the middle is about four of them and they are over at the French Village on Hardee.  The one here,  let' s see,  on your right is all throughout the northeastern apartment district,  and they' ve been there since close to dirt, because I remember them there over 40 years ago.  And then the one over here that you see on the far left, that' s the Highway Department and that' s on 8th,  Calle Ocho.  And then if you go to Bird Road,  the Highway Department has another one entirely which we don' t have a picture.  I could go on and on and on. We' ve got lots of these things. But the really cool thing is, when you walk it, when you cross that line from wherever it is, from Dade County or the City of Miami or South Miami, and you come here to this special place, its street jewelry embraces you.  If you would go to the next,  please.  We have a new monument that we' ve put in. We' ve put in the black lights,  nobody really thought about that.  And then we have these other kind of street poles I really like. Those are the ones that should be fixed and there' s quite a few like those ones without hats or ones that are broken,  or they are severely tilted over.
