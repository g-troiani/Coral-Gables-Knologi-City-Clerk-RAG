Effective July 1, 2023, the Act mandates local governments to amend zoning codes to facilitate affordable housing development, particularly by allowing reductions in parking requirements near major transit stops. It also authorizes the development of affordable housing units under these revised standards, representing a significant state-level intervention to preempt local zoning regulations and provide funding exceeding $800 million.
