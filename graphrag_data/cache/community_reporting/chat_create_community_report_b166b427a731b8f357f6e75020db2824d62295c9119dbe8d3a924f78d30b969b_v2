This section aims to convert overhead utility and communication services to underground installations to improve reliability, safety, and community aesthetics. It serves as the cornerstone for all related entities and requirements within this community, ensuring that utility infrastructure upgrades align with these objectives. The centrality of Section 78-281 is underscored by its direct relationship to the Underground Utilities Requirement entity, which operationalizes the code's mandates [Data: Entities (427, 428); Relationships (514)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Broad applicability of the Underground Utilities Requirement to utility lines\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Underground Utilities Requirement mandates that all utility lines—including electrical power distribution, telephone, communication, street lighting, and video service lines—be installed underground. This broad applicability is designed to enhance public safety by reducing hazards associated with overhead lines, improve service reliability, and promote better urban aesthetics by minimizing visual clutter. However, the requirement explicitly excludes certain categories such as transmission lines and city-owned network infrastructure, which are governed by separate regulations.

This exemption recognizes that certain utility lines and poles installed by the city itself are subject to different standards or operational considerations. The exemption ensures that the regulatory framework does not impose undue burdens on city-managed infrastructure while maintaining the overall goal of underground installation for other utility lines.
