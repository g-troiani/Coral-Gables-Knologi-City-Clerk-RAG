Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

There are those on the County Commission and in Tallahassee who are looking to maybe expand even further out west and further southwest,  but it is something that they are currently working on, and they look like they' d be able to get something done in the next couple of years.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Interesting.  My husband worked for the Mover,  that' s basically a bus on top of a platform,  its rubber tires.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s why I'm saying that' s a really long route for them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It is, and I guess that' s the way that they decided to move.  My dad actually was a quality assurance engineer for the Metro Mover for many years.  He worked with our ACM when he was there in transit.  It's definitely not Metro Rail. You can fit a lot less people, but it does have the ability to move a little bit quicker.   That' s the way that it has been explained to me. They' ll have more of them on the route and it's also cheaper to get the actual cars versus the rail cars.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  when I was on the TPO before the city was removed,  because of the census,  I knew that we were doing a people mover to Miami Beach.  I'm going to look up to see,  I'm going\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nto ask our representative,  the Director of the TPO to send me information because I know that they are trying to figure out ways to do it that is more affordable and they think the people mover could be an opportunity to save money,  but if they can get it out to FIU, trust me, it's a gamechanger. So, I want to - I'm going to call our director there and see if she can send us more info. Mr. Clerk anything else,  any other.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Alright. Can I get a motion.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'll move it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'll second.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Yes Commissioner Menendez:  Yes Vice Mayor Anderson:  Yes Commissioner Castro:  Yes Mayor Lago:  Yes Vote: 5-0)\n\n=== END OF ITEM E-5 TRANSCRIPT ===\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>County Commission<|>organization<|>The County Commission, a governing body mentioned as considering expansion of transit routes further west and southwest, currently working on related transit projects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Tallahassee<|>organization<|>Tallahassee, referenced as a location where officials are involved in planning transit expansions further west and southwest.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>person<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, a city official who discussed the Metro Mover transit system and personal connections to it, including her husband who worked for the Mover.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>person<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a city official who confirmed details about the Metro Mover and shared that his father was a quality assurance engineer for the Metro Mover and worked with the ACM in transit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>person<|>Mayor Lago, a city official who previously served on the TPO and is interested in the people mover project to Miami Beach and its potential extension to FIU, planning to contact the TPO director for more information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Metro Mover<|>project<|>The Metro Mover, a transit system described as a bus on a platform with rubber tires, capable of moving quicker than Metro Rail but with less capacity, currently in operation and considered for route expansion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Metro Rail<|>project<|>Metro Rail, a transit system contrasted with the Metro Mover, noted for having larger capacity but slower movement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TPO<|>organization<|>The Transportation Planning Organization (TPO), a regional planning body previously including the city before removal due to census changes, involved in planning transit projects such as the people mover to Miami Beach.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>People Mover to Miami Beach<|>project<|>A proposed people mover transit project to Miami Beach, considered by the TPO and city officials as a potentially more affordable transit option and a gamechanger if extended to FIU.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIU<|>organization<|>Florida International University (FIU), a location mentioned as a potential extension point for the people mover transit project.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>meeting<|>A City Commission Meeting during which the transit projects, including the Metro Mover and people mover, were discussed and a motion was passed unanimously (5-0).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Clerk Urquia<|>person<|>City Clerk Urquia, the city clerk present at the City Commission Meeting, responding to the mayor's inquiry.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Metro Mover<|>Vice Mayor Anderson discussed the Metro Mover transit system and mentioned her husband worked for the Mover, establishing a direct connection.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Metro Mover<|>Commissioner Fernandez confirmed details about the Metro Mover and shared that his father was a quality assurance engineer for it, showing a personal and professional connection.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>TPO<|>Mayor Lago referenced his prior service on the TPO and plans to contact the TPO director for more information about the people mover project.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>People Mover to Miami Beach<|>Mayor Lago expressed knowledge and interest in the people mover project to Miami Beach and its potential extension to FIU.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>People Mover to Miami Beach<|>FIU<|>The people mover project is considered for extension to FIU, described as a gamechanger if achieved.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Vice Mayor Anderson moved a motion during the City Commission Meeting.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Commissioner Fernandez seconded the motion during the City Commission Meeting.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>City Clerk Urquia<|>City Clerk Urquia participated in the City Commission Meeting, responding to the mayor.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>County Commission<|>Tallahassee<|>Both the County Commission and officials in Tallahassee are involved in planning transit expansions further west and southwest.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
