This process is initiated by individuals or entities other than the City and requires a comprehensive legislative procedure, including readings at two separate City Commission hearings. The amendment process ensures that any proposed changes to land use designations undergo thorough scrutiny and public input before adoption. This central role is underscored by its high degree of connectivity to other entities such as public hearings and publication notices, highlighting its pivotal function in local land use governance [Data: Entities (651); Relationships (814, 920, 923, 925)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Structured public hearing framework ensures transparency and community involvement\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The community includes a multi-tiered public hearing framework involving the Planning and Zoning Board Public Hearing, the City Commission Public Hearing, and the City Commission Adoption Hearing. Each hearing serves a distinct role in the legislative process for zoning amendments. The Planning and Zoning Board Public Hearing provides an initial forum for discussion and community input, requiring at least ten days' public notice. Subsequently, the City Commission holds two hearings: the first public hearing with a minimum seven-day notice and the adoption hearing with at least five days' notice.

For example, zoning district map amendments require a publication notice of at least ten days before the Planning and Zoning Board hearing. Similarly, other amendments, including comprehensive plan changes, have specified publication timelines before respective hearings. These notices are essential for ensuring that affected parties and the broader community have adequate time to prepare and participate in hearings, reinforcing the principles of transparency and due process in land use governance [Data: Relationships (814, 916, 922, 921)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Special considerations for large-scale district map amendments\",\n      \"explanation\": \"District map amendments involving ten or more contiguous acres are subject to additional scrutiny and notification requirements.

In contrast, small-scale amendments require a ten-day notice before the Planning and Zoning Board hearing and five days before the City Commission adoption hearing.
