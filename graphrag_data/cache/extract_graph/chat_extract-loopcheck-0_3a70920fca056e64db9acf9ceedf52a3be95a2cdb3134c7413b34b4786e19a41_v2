The request that we are making today is to demolish an existing building that sits at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia and replace it with another building.   The idea is -- well, the reason for it is the building was old, had sagging floors and had a lot of issues and it made more sense to demolish the building and build a new one.   The new structure will be approximately the same size.   It will house the same two classrooms,  Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, a multi-purpose room and storage area.  The difference in the square footage is that there is now a covered walkway that is a canopy and it's an awning and that,  for security purposes,  will be enclosed and it will connect to another building on the campus.   Let' s see,  the Board of Architects has approved the new building. We went twice to the Board of Architects.   They wanted windows on the eastern side of the new building.   One of the conditions that was imposed in the 2001-2003 master plan would be that no building would have any windows on the eastern side.  Board of Architects insisted that it would look too institutional,  which is what we were trying to avoid,  and so they asked that we change that condition and the windows are fixed and operable windows.   They' re meant for an aesthetic purpose,  not to function.   They are actually on the portion of the building that' s closest to the front, which is adjacent to the driveway and garage of the adjacent neighbor to the east of us.   The balance of the building,  which is in back,  which would face the single- family neighbor to the right is solid and there' s extensive landscaping that' s several feet wide that was put in back in 2003 as part of the condition for the original site plan. We appeared before the Planning and Zoning Board. Staff recommended approval with three conditions,  that the windows remain fixed and inoperative,  that we keep every other condition,  including the limitation on the number of children,  and that we heavily landscape the front part of this building.  During COVID, the front part of this building was graveled in order to facilitate the drop-off when we first started going back to school.  And so it has remained gravel. That gravel will be removed after construction and that area in front of this will be heavily landscaped.   So, right now the drop-off is set up.  There is a drop-off for the older grades.   Third, fourth,  and fifth grade are dropped off in front of the school.   Four parking spaces are coned off and the parents come in going east to west so that the children can be dropped off on the sidewalk side and not on the street side.   And a neighbor that -who is here as well has appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and an additional condition was added to the approval. And the condition was that the church landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia. And so we' re here to respectfully request that we keep the conditions that were imposed by staff and eliminate that condition and I'd like to explain why.   First of all, those are not adjacent neighbors.   Those four properties,  one of them happens to belong to the church,  the one on the corner of --  the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova belongs to St. Philip' s. The other three are not adjacent, meaning they don' t abut the school property. We are not proposing an increase in students,  so we are not making a bigger impact.   The same number of students,  180, have gone to this school since 2001.  We are in an area where the increased activity and need for parking has come from the beautiful playground equipment that now adorns\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nSalvadore Park.   Having used it as a mother,  it's a vast improvement from what it was 30-some years ago.   There is also,  as you know, very active use of the tennis courts,  starting from early in the morning now that one of the courts has been designated a pickleball court,  one of the most popular sports in in the country.   And you also now have a dog park.  So, it is a neighborhood that has a lot of activity.   The school is there 172 days out of 365.   Yes,  the church does have its activities,  but I would submit to you that the school is not the only reason why there' s an issue with parking.   And I think it' s not fair to penalize the nonprofit school and institution that lives there,  but rather we should try to work as a community,  both the City and the church and school, to see if we can find a way to alleviate the parking on swales.   I brought --  because I want you to know the school tries very hard to make sure that parents don' t park in the swale.   That doesn' t mean they don' t, but they try very hard.   And I just brought two samples of newsletters.   So, this newsletter is published monthly,  and it goes out to all the school parents,  and I highlighted -there' s a whole section on parking.   I'm going to pass these around.   So,  it's not something that they say once at the beginning of the school year during orientation and just say,  okay,  we hope you guys pay attention to it.  No, they' re reminded on a regular basis,  and I can tell you that the Ed Diaz,  who' s chief of operations,  has been called by nearby residents\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EXISTING BUILDING<|>PROJECT<|>An existing building located at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia, characterized by old structure, sagging floors, and multiple issues leading to the decision to demolish it and replace with a new building)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW BUILDING<|>PROJECT<|>A new building planned to replace the existing one at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia; approximately the same size, housing two classrooms (Pre-K 3 and Pre-K 4), a multi-purpose room, and storage area; includes a covered walkway canopy enclosed for security connecting to another building on campus; windows on the eastern side are fixed and operable for aesthetic purposes only)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF ARCHITECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Board of Architects, an organization responsible for approving architectural plans; approved the new building after two reviews and required changes to window design on the eastern side to avoid an institutional look)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2001-2003 MASTER PLAN<|>PROJECT<|>A master plan from 2001-2003 that included a condition prohibiting windows on the eastern side of buildings; this condition was challenged and modified for the new building's window design)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Planning and Zoning Board, a city staff and regulatory body that reviewed and recommended approval of the new building project with three conditions related to window operation, existing conditions, and landscaping)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>PROJECT<|>Fixed and operable windows on the eastern side of the new building, installed for aesthetic purposes only as required by the Board of Architects to avoid an institutional appearance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANDSCAPING<|>PROJECT<|>Landscaping installed extensively behind the building as part of the original 2003 site plan conditions, and planned heavy landscaping in front of the new building after construction to replace gravel used during COVID drop-off facilitation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DROP-OFF AREA<|>PROJECT<|>Designated drop-off area for older grades (third, fourth, and fifth) in front of the school with four parking spaces coned off; parents drop off children on the sidewalk side to enhance safety)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHURCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A church adjacent to the school property, involved in a condition requiring it to landscape and maintain swales of properties from Coral Way to Andalusia; one of the four properties involved belongs to St. Philip's Church)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST.
