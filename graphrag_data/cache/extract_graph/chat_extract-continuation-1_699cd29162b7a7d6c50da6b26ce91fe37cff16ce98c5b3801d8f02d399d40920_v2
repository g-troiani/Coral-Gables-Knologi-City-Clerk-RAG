So affordable is defined by Chapter 420 of the Florida State Statutes to mean the monthly rents, including taxes,  insurance, and utilities cannot cost more than 30 percent of the local median adjusted income ( AMI). In that case it' s Miami-Dade County.  So,  it's not considered for a city whereâ€¦ is going to be through countywide and that' s according to the Florida State Statutes.  So,  what is affordable?  There is a resource at floridahousing. org that has these rent limits that we' ll be referring to. So, you can see from the snippet here,  that there' s different percentages of the base of the AMI, which in MiamiDade County is 74,700, and what' s highlighted at the bottom is 120 percent of that amount.  So, for example,  a studio in our city could be deemed affordable and would be just over $ 2,100 and that would be the maximum rent that would be allowed.  Another example,  a two-bedroom would be just over $2,700. So, the Live Local Act also automatically approves height through the highest height within one mile. As you know, we have three zoning districts, MX1, 2, and 3, and that limits the heights.  However,  it's preempted that they will have the highest height within one mile. So, these are maps that our amazing GIS team provided for us and it's showing a radius from those MX2 and MX3 districts. MX2 district is a 70-foot height limitation that' s shown in the bluish/ gray color and 150 is the MX3 maximum height,  which is shown in the greenish color.  And then the density is also preempted by the state to be analyzed citywide.  So,  while the height is analyzed within one mile of the development,  the density is analyzed citywide maximum.  So, the maximum density in our city is 125 units an acre,  as our density is calculated by units per acre and the maximum is 125. So, we do have areas in our city that allow for a limited density that is our Central Business District and our Design and Innovation District, and if an affordable housing development would develop in those areas,  they would be allowed to have also a limited density, but not outside.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  If I may, just as a refresher.  There may be a limited density,  but you' re still required to have a limit in regard to the size of the unit, correct.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, all thoseâ€¦\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s kind of your bookend.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes.  So,  all those zoning parameters such as FAR,  maximum,  open spaceâ€¦\n\nMayor Lago: You are mentioning limited density and people think, oh my God, you give thousands of units in one building.  You can' t because you end up eating away at the square footage because you have a cap on a minimum size of a unit size.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And parking.\n\nMayor Lago:  And parking,  so you keep going higher and the higher you go you meet the parking requirement,  the parking pedestals eat away.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  So,  the FAR,  the floor area ratio is very important to control how the scale of that development,  because 3.5 FAR, which is our maximum in our mixed- use district is quite limiting when it comes to reaching 190 feet. So, the ACT also preempts the approval process that has to be approved administratively for the density,  the height,  and the land use. So, properties in our zoning code right now, we require a conditional use process for properties that are greater than 20,000 square feet, and now it goes through the Development Review Committee,  the Board of Architects, Planning and Zoning,  and the City Commission. This will also apply for any development that would honor the Live Local Act to go through that process,  but the Commission would consider other zoning code regulations,  such as FAR,  such as open space on the ground level, parking as well, all those other zoning considerations.  The Commission is preempted to have consideration when it comes to use, height,  and density.  And any property that' s less than 20,000 square feet would not require the building peer review process.  It would go through DRC,  our Board of Architects,  and from there go to permitting.  So, in summary,  the preemption is for the use,  the density,  and the height.  The use is for mixed- use districts.  I just went through the map of where those districts are in our urban areas, analyzed citywide and the height is whatever is allowed within one mile of that proposed property.  So,  the legislation before you today is what the Live Local Act is requiring the city to consider and that is a parking reduction within a half-a-mile of the development and the city can define what major transit stop means.  So, the legislation before you is to find major transit stop as a metro station or the intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with frequencies of service intervals of 15 minutes or less,  during morning and afternoon peak commute periods. So, taking a look at the better bus network, there have\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF SOUTH MIAMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Municipal government entity referenced as the location of the urban center near Red Road and Sunset.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORIDA STATE STATUTES CHAPTER 420<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Legal statute defining affordable housing criteria including rent limits as a percentage of local median adjusted income.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIAMI-DADE COUNTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>County jurisdiction used as the reference area for median adjusted income calculations.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLORIDAHOUSING.ORG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Online resource providing rent limits and affordable housing data referenced in the discussion.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIVE LOCAL ACT<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>State legislation automatically approving maximum building height within one mile radius and preempting local zoning regulations on height, density, and use.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MX1<|>PROJECT<|>Zoning district with specific height and density regulations within the city.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MX2<|>PROJECT<|>Zoning district with a 70-foot height limitation, shown in bluish/gray color on GIS maps.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MX3<|>PROJECT<|>Zoning district with a 150-foot maximum height limitation, shown in greenish color on GIS maps.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT<|>PROJECT<|>City area allowing limited density for development.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESIGN AND INNOVATION DISTRICT<|>PROJECT<|>City area allowing limited density for affordable housing developments.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>Official meeting forum where city officials discuss zoning, affordable housing, and related legislation.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor presiding over the City Commission Meeting, providing clarifications on zoning and density.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING OFFICIAL GARCIA<|>PERSON<|>City planning official explaining zoning parameters such as FAR, density, and parking.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY MANAGER IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City manager participating in the discussion on zoning and parking.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAR (FLOOR AREA RATIO)<|>PROJECT<|>Zoning parameter controlling the scale of development, with a maximum of 3.5 in mixed-use districts.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE (DRC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City committee involved in reviewing developments greater than 20,000 square feet.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF ARCHITECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City board involved in the review process for development projects.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City board involved in zoning and planning decisions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAJOR TRANSIT STOP<|>PROJECT<|>Defined as a metro station or intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with service intervals of 15 minutes or less during peak commute periods.)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
