Specifically, these neon signs violate rules concerning their placement on windows and the required distance from certain locations, indicating a need for regulatory enforcement or adjustment.\n\nAdditionally, the City has installed signs aimed at keeping people off corners and preventing the blocking of intersection visibility to enhance safety. Despite these efforts, it was acknowledged that signs alone are insufficient to fully resolve the problems, suggesting that additional measures are necessary to effectively manage parking and enforcement near schools and intersections.\n\nOverall, signs in Coral Gables serve multiple functions related to public safety and regulatory compliance, but challenges remain regarding their proper use, placement, and overall effectiveness.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749563705, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 468, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
