following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

The owner of property shall be deemed to be the person shown on the then- current tax assessment roll, and such notice shall be sent to the address given on such assessment roll for that purpose.  Notice shall be mailed at least two weeks prior to the date of the meeting before the development review committee and the planning and zoning board at which the application shall be considered. The notice provided shall also advise property owners that they may provide comments in writing and/ or verbally at the board meeting at which same is to be considered.\n- 5)Forward the planning and zoning board's recommendations for public hearing at the appropriate city commission meeting.\n\n6)Notify by certified mail the owners and occupants of real property, as identified above, of the public hearing to be held before the city commission.\n\n7)Notify the general public by causing to be published a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of the public hearing to be held by the city commission on the application.\n\n## Sec.  62-331. -  Adoption of ordinance.\n\nIf the city commission adopts an ordinance granting the application,  notice thereof shall be published one time,  within 30 days following the date of adoption of said ordinance,  in a newspaper of general circulation published in the city. The proof of publication of the notice of hearing and a proof of publication of the notice of the adoption of the ordinance and a copy of the ordinance shall be recorded in the public records of the county. Upon adoption of an ordinance approving an application, a certified copy of same shall be filed in the public records of the county.  The costs of all notices required pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be borne by the applicant.\n\n## Sec.  78-281. -  Requirement for underground utilities.\n\na)Purpose. The purpose of this [article] is to promote the conversion of existing overhead utility and communications service to underground and to require the installation of utility and communication service facilities underground, individually and collectively to promote general reliability of utility and communications service, public safety, foster tree and vegetation canopy preservation,  business and lifestyle continuity through continued utility and communication service after major weather events, and improve and protect the aesthetic character of the city b)Applicability. Except as expressly provided hereinafter, all utility lines,  including, but not limited to,  those required for electrical power distribution, and those such lines, cables, and conduits for telephone, and communication, street lighting,  and video service shall be installed underground.  This section shall apply to all cables,  conduits or wires forming part of an electrical distribution system including service lines to individual properties and main feeder and lateral distribution electric lines delivering power to local distribution systems, provided that it shall not apply to wires, conductors or associated apparatus and supporting structures whose exclusive function is in transmission of electrical energy between generating stations,  substations,  and transmission lines of other utility systems.  City installed utility lines and poles shall not be subject to the provisions of this article,  including,  but not limited to,  city-owned network infrastructure. Appurtenances to support underground utility lines,  cables,  conduits,  and other equipment such as transformers, pedestal and pad-mounted terminal boxes, and meter cabinets, may be located above ground in appropriate utility easements and in conformance with the requirements of the public works department.  This section 78-281 shall be applicable to the following uses:( 1)Except for rehabilitation of structures of less than 50 percent of value,  all new\n\nconstruction and utility and communications installations shall be required to be underground.( 2)When a structure undergoes a rehabilitation wherein the cost of the rehabilitation is 50 percent or more of the replacement value of the existing structure as determined by the Miami- Dade County Property Appraiser, utility and communications service facilities for that structure shall be converted from overhead to underground.\n\nc)Conversion of overhead to underground facilities.  Whenever overhead utility lines or distribution facilities have been converted to underground facilities,  the following shall be required:(1)The property owners in the area to be served by the new facilities shall be required to arrange for the conversion of their existing service facilities in accordance with these regulations and, where applicable, utility company specifications for underground service. For electric service facilities, such conversion shall include but shall not be limited to rearranging existing electric drop and service entrance facilities and necessary facilities within buildings and structures to accommodate the undergrounding of utilities. The property owner shall be responsible for all costs associated with the modification of service facilities for the affected property to accommodate underground utility service to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law and if not otherwise paid by the utility company.( 2)When a pole owner engages in undergrounding its facilities and equipment that will result in a redundant pole,  the pole owner shall be required to provide notice to attaching entities and to the city. Attaching entities shall be required to underground their facilities and equipment or remove all attachments from a redundant pole in coordination with the pole owner.  The city may,  at its discretion but without obligation of any kind,  provide a courtesy notice to the attaching entity of the planned or intended overhead to underground conversion project being performed or affecting any area of the city rendering the pole unused for electrical distribution purposes. Failure by any attaching entity to remove pole attachments shall constitute a code enforcement violation under section 101-137 of this Code. Fines shall accrue on a per pole basis,  and shall continue\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>62-330<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Document number 62-330 referenced in the context of providing recommendations to the city commission regarding property and right-of-way abandonment procedures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNERS<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Notice to owners of real property bounding and abutting the right-of-way or easement or city property proposed to be abandoned, including owners within 1,000 feet if a street or alley is to be abandoned, sent by mail at least two weeks prior to the meeting before the development review committee and planning and zoning board, advising owners they may provide comments in writing or verbally at the board meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE MEETING<|>MEETING<|>Meeting of the development review committee where applications for abandonment are considered, preceded by mailed notice to property owners.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD MEETING<|>MEETING<|>Meeting of the planning and zoning board where applications for abandonment are considered, preceded by mailed notice to property owners.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>Appropriate city commission meeting where public hearings on applications for abandonment are held, following recommendations from the planning and zoning board.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE BY CERTIFIED MAIL<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Notice sent by certified mail to owners and occupants of real property regarding the public hearing before the city commission on the application.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE BY NEWSPAPER<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Notice published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city to notify the general public of the public hearing to be held by the city commission on the application.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE ADOPTION NOTICE<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Notice published one time within 30 days following the adoption of an ordinance granting the application, in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, with proof of publication and a copy of the ordinance recorded in the public records of the county.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance adopted by the city commission granting the application for abandonment, with a certified copy filed in the public records of the county.
