The community includes entities related to transportation funding, such as asphalt funding and rail infrastructure projects, as well as the airport rail connection and first responders who are impacted by transportation challenges.

Lago’s advocacy is grounded in the belief that transit services should not be expected to turn a profit unrealistically, emphasizing the need for public investment rather than market-driven funding models.
