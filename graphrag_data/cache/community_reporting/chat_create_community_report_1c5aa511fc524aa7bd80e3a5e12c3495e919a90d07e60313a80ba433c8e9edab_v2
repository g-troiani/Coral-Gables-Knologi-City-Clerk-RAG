The relationships define a regulatory framework where property owners receive formal notices with specified deadlines to complete conversions, failing which the city manager orders conversion at the owner's expense and imposes liens.

Certified mail may be sent to registered agents for corporate property owners or to addresses listed in tax or property appraiser databases.

This owner may receive official notices, including those sent by certified mail or other methods, and has the option to provide the city with a written address specifically for receiving such communications. In the context of utility service facility conversions, the PROPERTY OWNER is subject to specific obligations. They receive notices regarding the completion or failure of required utility conversions and are responsible for ensuring that these conversions are completed within designated timeframes. Failure to complete the required conversions can result in the PROPERTY OWNER being held liable for associated costs and potential liens placed on the property. Overall, the PROPERTY OWNER plays a central role in managing compliance with property-related notices and utility service requirements.\",8\n196,NOTICE OF PROPERTY OWNER'S FAILURE TO CONVERT FACILITIES,\"A written notice sent by the city manager to property owners whose buildings have not completed conversion to underground utility service facilities.

In this case, the notice must be published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation, with a minimum interval of seven days between the publications, and the first publication must occur at least 30 days before the required conversion date. Another use of newspaper publication is to announce public hearings on proposed rates, fees, and charges.
