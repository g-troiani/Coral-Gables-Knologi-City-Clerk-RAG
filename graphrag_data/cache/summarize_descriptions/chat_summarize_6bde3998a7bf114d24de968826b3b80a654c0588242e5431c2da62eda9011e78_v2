Over time, the school has been expanding its physical footprint by purchasing adjacent single-family homes, thereby increasing its square footage. This expansion has raised concerns among community members, including the Toyos family, who allege that the school’s acquisitions may violate existing covenants and contribute to neighborhood parking and maintenance issues.\n\nDespite lacking dedicated parking facilities, the school actively manages parking challenges by regularly communicating parking rules to parents through monthly newsletters and attempting to prevent parking on swales to minimize neighborhood disruption. The school’s operations and expansion efforts have been a recurring topic in local governance, notably discussed during a City Commission Meeting where the matter was a time certain agenda item that extended beyond its scheduled duration. These discussions have focused on the impacts of parking, adherence to student number limits, and compliance with prior approvals and recorded covenants.\n\nThe SCHOOL remains engaged in ongoing negotiations with neighbors and city officials to address concerns related to parking, property use, and covenant compliance, striving to balance its growth with community interests and regulatory requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840847, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 533, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
