This includes requiring permits for the construction of bulkheads, seawalls, groins, breakwaters, wharves, docks, piers, and other related structures, as well as shore activities such as beach nourishment on submerged, tidal, or upland lands contiguous to the shoreline. The department reviews proposed construction plans, conducts investigations, and makes recommendations to the city commission prior to public hearings on permit applications. Upon approval by the city commission and relevant agencies, the department issues construction permits and ensures compliance with all permit requirements. This oversight includes establishing construction standards, determining appropriate performance bond amounts, requiring bond postings, and supervising engineering certifications throughout the construction process. Additionally, the City Public Works Department manages administrative responsibilities such as submitting written requests for extensions of permit timeframes before expiration, thereby ensuring that all waterfront construction and shore activities are conducted safely, legally, and in accordance with municipal regulations.\",5\n222,CONSTRUCTION PERMIT,\"A construction permit is an authorization issued by the city Public Works Department that allows for the construction of proposed structures or shore activities. This permit is typically valid for less than one year from the date of issuance but may be extended upon approval by the relevant agencies and submission of a written extension request. To obtain the permit, applicants—often certified contractors—must meet specific conditions, including the submission of detailed construction plans, payment of required fees, posting a performance bond to ensure project completion, and providing certification of engineering supervision throughout the construction process. Compliance with these conditions is mandatory for both the issuance and any potential extension of the permit.\",9\n215,PERFORMANCE BOND,\"The PERFORMANCE BOND is a financial guarantee posted by the permit applicant or certified contractor to protect public and landowner interests during activities such as dredging or filling work.
