strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Not only revamp it,  but also make it more redundant and beautify the city,  especially our tree canopy which in some areas is killed or destroyed as a result of power lines that run through them.  So, I agree with you. I just think that this is a process that we have to be honest with ourselves.  It's going to take time. For example,  the White Way Lights that we' re refurbishing now, we had to take out, I think it was a little over $ 2 million dollars from Art in Public Places,  which again,  was something that I didn' t want to do, I didn' t want to do, but I pushed that forward because I think its something important and we can see these lights as, not only historic,  but also as art and we' re able to bridge that gap with the help\n\nof our City Attorney to find a solution for that.  But this is a multi-million- dollar situation that we' re in and we have to have real conversations with FPL and see how we can bridge that gap, and maybe somebody on this Commission needs to be named.  I welcome any of my colleagues, whoever they' d like to name,  so that we can have someone dedicated to work on this issue with FPL to find a solution.  It may take six months,  it may take a year,  or it may be resolved in two weeks,  who knows.  But I think that once we have further conversations with FPL, I think we can find uniformity,  but I agree with you.  Future developments need to come online and find that uniform color that uniform look, so we have something a little bit more standard across the board.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  And if we go back to even replacing some of the lights that have been in, that' s not a problem,  because these lights are reusable, the wiring is reusable, everything. We' ve been through lots and lots of hurricanes on these things and the lights have all been there and they are still there. So, we are having an enjoyable time and our record shows that we' ve had a wonderful conversation as just as you said Mayor, with leadership by the Mayor,  by the Manager,  and by the Commission to do this and this was a multi-year process that previous Commissions, previous Managers,  and all went through to come up with what we' ve got,  and you know it takes a long time to evolve you know, and we' ve evolved into the best city in South Florida, if not the best city in Florida.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you for putting that together.  Mr. Manager.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  we have a complete presentation ready for the next Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And we' ve also asked FPL to join us at the next Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  What I would like to do when we have that presentation for the next Commission meeting,  I know Commissioner Fernandez put the item on the agenda,  I'd like for you to be here, obviously and anyone you' d like to bring that' s part of the board.  That' s one of the reasons why I sponsored the Landmark Advisory Board,  I pushed that forward,  to bridge that gap and to find an opportunity to make sure that we are addressing our landmarks and that they are not falling behind, because I'd rather,  I'd like to have the Landmark making noise, advisory board making noise that these landmarks are falling behind,  we need to address these issues,  and there' s a lot of people on that board that are very, very well versed on issues of historic preservation,  landmark,  we have a great team here. So, I'd like to have you here at the next meeting to make sure that you' re part of the conversation and it should be a conversation that' s had by everybody in this community.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  And it is a conversation,  Mr. Mayor. There' re no accusations of anything.  This is a positive direction for our community that will only make it better.\n\nMayor Lago:  This was started before,  this was started like in, when was the time that this was approved,  this rate.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  But before that, it was like 20 years ago,  wasn' t there a discussion on it, on the light poles? Maybe I'm confused.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  The new rate started about five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  the point is that we' ve got to figure out a solution and find something that' s appropriate and we' d love to have you and everybody else in regard to that conversation.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Mayor,  thank you. Its an honor. Its an honor to be with you and I thank you all for your consideration and your time. Thank you all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'm going to take the moment just for a short advertisement.  My Landmark Advisory Board appointee sent me an email indicating that she needs to step down, so if you know of anybody that is interested in serving,  I'd like to have a reappointment for the next Commission meeting,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2789c0ca149e77689bb93d34b054aa113df998835811d787b8e27b32f797a431_v2"}
