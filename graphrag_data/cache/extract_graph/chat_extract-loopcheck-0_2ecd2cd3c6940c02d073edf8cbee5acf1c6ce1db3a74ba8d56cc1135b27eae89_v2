I know I didn' t ask you to do this before,  I just kind of found out about this ordinance on Friday,  so we really didn' t have much time to really go over it, and I thought about it over the weekend.   I didn' t want to bother you over the weekend. So,  when we talked about the wrap ordinance that I sponsored in 2022,  how long did we work on that,  how much input did we garner from the community?   Because we transformed wraps,  the wraps that weâ€¦\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Right, yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   Put on the businesses now.  How did we do that?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   It was a process.\n\nMayor Lago:   To the best that you remember.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I would say probably two to three months that we worked on it and we refined it.   We looked at other communities to see what they were doing.   We talked I personally talked to the City of Miami Beach.\n\nMayor Lago:   We met with Mark Trowbridge.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Obviously,  we involved the Chamber as well.\n\nMayor Lago:   The BID back then.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Yes,  and the BID, because it was --  it was an iteration that we took of the Business Improvement District.   They had a wrap, but we basically wanted to do it citywide also.   So,  it wasn' t just,  you know, the Central Business District or the BID area. So, yeah,  it took a bit.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  and I remember that I also,  if I remember correctly,  and the Clerk can make a public records request,  we also put it as a discussion item to get input from the Commission before we even embarked on the ordinance process to see if there was buy-in.  I try to do that as much as I possibly can just to make sure that if anybody has any input, they can, you know, provide that input and they can --  we can move forward on a process that has some sort of legs before we move further.   I'll give you an example.   So, the faux grass in the front of homes that we see now in driveways.   That was something that I put as a discussion item,  I think probably one or two times.  We brought it on first reading,  and then obviously,  Commissioner Fernandez requested that it go to the BOA.  The BOA was resoundingly in support of it, it came back, and it failed with the Commission.   That' s what I would recommend.   I would recommend that,  in my opinion,  is that you get some input from the Chamber,  at a minimum,  the Chamber.   They are the heart and pulse of the business community here.   We have a great Chamber.   Again,  Mark and the Chair to really give some input,  to sit down,  and as a licensed realtor,  I can tell you who has purchased a good amount of commercial real estate,  some of my best finds, some of my best finds have been walking by a property.   And one of the things that we' re not discussing today,  and I can give you examples of that, where both in the City of Coral Gables and outside the City, I've been walking or driving by, and I have found a piece of property where, you know, there was a sign, I hadn' t even engaged LoopNet,  or I hadn' t even engaged the MLS.   That' s number one.   Number two, a lot of people don' t even have MLS.   They don' t.  They don' t want to pay the fee,  it's not a requirement,  and they don' t have LoopNet yet. Another issue that I'm seeing is obviously the DBPR.   This is something that I was researching very quickly.   We, as a Commission,  got multiple emails from realtors and calls in opposition of this.  I didn' t have one person that told me that this was a good idea,  but I'm always willing to look at the other side of the coin if it makes sense.   But one of the things that they brought to my attention was listen,  Vince,  the DBPR has certain language that' s required,  that' s required to be exhibited on the for sale or for lease or for rent signage.   It makes it incredibly difficult to fit all that language on such a small,  you know, little piece of document that is exhibited for sale or for lease.  Another issue that we haven' t discussed,  but I think it's something that you should consider when you' re talking with all these leaders of industry.   I talked to the head of the Real Estate --  South Florida Real Estate Association,  which is located here in Coral Gables,  adjacent to the fire station.   I know that they' re in opposition of this issue.  Was something that I just thought about right now.  What about for sale by owner?  I bought one property for sale by owner from a lady who, in the building that I was living in, I happened to just walk by and she had this sign in the apartment building,  when I used to live in 100 Edgewater,  over a decade ago. So, I happened to walk by, she was selling it for sale by owner,  I negotiated with her, and I ended up buying the property.   How are we going to address for sale by owner signage\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WRAP ORDINANCE 2022<|>ORDINANCE<|>An ordinance sponsored in 2022 concerning regulations on wraps, developed over two to three months with community input and refinement, including consultation with other communities such as the City of Miami Beach and local business organizations.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR PEREZ<|>PERSON<|>Economic Development Director involved in the wrap ordinance process, providing details on the timeline and community engagement.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor participating in the discussion about the wrap ordinance and other city matters, including agenda items and public input processes.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARK TROWBRIDGE<|>PERSON<|>Individual met with by city officials during the wrap ordinance development process.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAMBER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Local business chamber involved in the wrap ordinance discussions and community input.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business Improvement District, originally having a wrap ordinance which was iterated to a citywide wrap ordinance.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF MIAMI BEACH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Referenced as a community consulted during the wrap ordinance development.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENDA ITEM DISCUSSION ITEM<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>General reference to discussion items used to gather input from the Commission before ordinance processes.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAUX GRASS DISCUSSION ITEM<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Discussion item concerning faux grass in front of homes, brought up one or two times, including first reading and referral to the BOA.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Board of Adjustment, which reviewed the faux grass item and supported it before it failed with the Commission.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City Commission involved in discussion and decision-making on agenda items and ordinances.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner who requested the faux grass item be sent to the BOA for review.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DBPR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department of Business and Professional Regulation, referenced regarding signage language requirements for real estate signs.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH FLORIDA REAL ESTATE ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization located in Coral Gables, adjacent to the fire station, opposed to certain signage regulations.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOR SALE BY OWNER SIGNAGE ISSUE<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Issue raised concerning signage for properties sold by owner, including challenges with existing regulations and practical examples.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>100 EDGEWATER PROPERTY SALE<|>PROJECT<|>Example of a property sold by owner, illustrating real-world implications of signage regulations.)##\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRAP ORDINANCE 2022<|>CHAMBER<|>The Chamber was involved in the development and input process for the wrap ordinance.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRAP ORDINANCE 2022<|>BID<|>The wrap ordinance was an iteration of the Business Improvement District's previous wrap regulations.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRAP ORDINANCE 2022<|>CITY OF MIAMI BEACH<|>City of Miami Beach was consulted as a reference community during ordinance development.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRAP ORDINANCE 2022<|>MARK TROWBRIDGE<|>Mark Trowbridge was met with during the ordinance development process.<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAUX GRASS DISCUSSION ITEM<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>Commissioner Fernandez requested the faux grass item be sent to the BOA.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAUX GRASS DISCUSSION ITEM<|>BOA<|>BOA reviewed and supported the faux grass item before it failed with the Commission.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAUX GRASS DISCUSSION ITEM<|>COMMISSION<|>The Commission ultimately failed the faux grass item after BOA support.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOR SALE BY OWNER SIGNAGE ISSUE<|>DBPR<|>DBPR regulations impact the for sale by owner signage issue due to language requirements.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOR SALE BY OWNER SIGNAGE ISSUE<|>SOUTH FLORIDA REAL ESTATE ASSOCIATION<|>The Association is opposed to the signage regulations affecting for sale by owner signs.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOR SALE BY OWNER SIGNAGE ISSUE<|>100 EDGEWATER PROPERTY SALE<|>The property sale example illustrates practical challenges related to for sale by owner signage.<|>8)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
