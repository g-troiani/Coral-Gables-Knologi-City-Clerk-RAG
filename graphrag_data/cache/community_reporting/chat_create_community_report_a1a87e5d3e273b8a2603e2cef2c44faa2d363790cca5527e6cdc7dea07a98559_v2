It is issued by the public works department following approval from the City Commission and other relevant agencies, underscoring its regulatory significance. The permit is valid for less than three years and may be extended for good cause, ensuring ongoing oversight of the permitted activities. Applicants must submit detailed construction plans, pay fees, post a performance bond, and provide certification from a registered engineer, which collectively ensure that the work complies with established standards and is properly monitored throughout its duration.

It acts as a security measure to ensure that the permit holder adheres to all permit conditions and regulatory requirements. The bond amount is determined by the Director of Public Works and is designed to cover potential costs arising from non-compliance or damages. The minimum bond amount is set at either $1,000 or 25% of the estimated cost of the work, whichever is lesser, while the maximum can be up to 100% of the estimated cost. This bond remains valid for at least six months after the approved completion date, providing a financial safeguard that incentivizes compliance and accountability.

These documents are prepared to comply with the public works department's requirements and serve as a technical blueprint for the dredging or filling work. Their submission is mandatory and is a critical component of the permit approval process, ensuring that the proposed work meets all engineering and environmental standards. This requirement helps prevent substandard or unsafe construction practices and facilitates regulatory review and oversight.

This interdependency ensures that the permit is not merely a procedural formality but is backed by a financial instrument that holds the permit holder accountable. The bond protects public and landowner interests by providing a mechanism to address any violations or failures to meet permit obligations.

This variability allows the bond amount to be tailored to the scale and risk profile of the specific dredging or filling project, ensuring proportional financial coverage. This flexible yet regulated approach balances the need for adequate financial guarantees with fairness to permit applicants.
