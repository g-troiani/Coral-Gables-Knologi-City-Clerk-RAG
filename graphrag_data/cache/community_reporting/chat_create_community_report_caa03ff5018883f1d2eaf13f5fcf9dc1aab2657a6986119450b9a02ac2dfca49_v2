Following the approval of a Zoning in Progress Resolution, City staff report to the Board, which plays a key role in reviewing and advising on zoning and land use issues. The Board holds public hearings on a variety of planning matters, including Comprehensive Plan updates, Zoning Code text amendments, and Zoning District map amendments involving areas larger than 10 acres.\n\nThe Board is actively involved in the site plan review and approval process, considering requests and reviewing the entire record after duly advertised public hearings in accordance with the zoning code and relevant municipal sections (62-328 and 62-330). It provides recommendations to the City Commission based on these reviews and the input received during hearings. The Board also reviews major amendments to site plans and changes in land use or zoning, ensuring that developments comply with city regulations and community standards.\n\nIn addition to its regulatory functions, the Planning and Zoning Board addresses local planning concerns such as parking and neighborhood infrastructure. For example, it has requested the expansion of swale improvements along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia to mitigate parking and related issues. The Board has also sought cooperation from clients and stakeholders to develop swale packages, reflecting its involvement in public safety and neighborhood quality of life matters. At times, the Board has directed responsibility for certain issues to other parties, emphasizing collaborative problem-solving.\n\nThe Board’s recommendations often include specific conditions to balance development goals with community interests. For instance, in reviewing a school project, the Board recommended approval with three conditions: windows facing the east neighbor must remain fixed and inoperative, limitations on the number of children must be maintained, and heavy landscaping should be installed at the front of the building. Similarly, for a major amendment approved in November, the Board imposed conditions including non-operable fixed windows facing neighboring properties and required swale improvements.\n\nThroughout its activities, the Planning and Zoning Board serves as a critical intermediary between City staff, developers, residents, and the City Commission, ensuring that zoning and planning decisions are made transparently and with due consideration of all relevant factors. It plays a vital role in shaping the City’s development patterns, maintaining neighborhood character, and addressing infrastructure and environmental concerns related to land use and zoning.\",28\n616,MS.

Since 2001, the school has maintained a stable enrollment of approximately 180 students and operates for 172 days each year. Over the past 22 years, the school has consistently worked to manage parking and neighborhood concerns, particularly those arising during student pickup and drop-off times. Despite lacking dedicated parking facilities, the school actively discourages parking violations by parents through measures such as publishing monthly newsletters with parking reminders and enforcing staff-imposed parking conditions.\n\nThe school’s property and operations have been the subject of ongoing discussions at City Commission meetings, including the session on January 9, 2024, where topics such as property use, master site planning, restrictive covenants, and potential expansion were addressed. The school is currently subject to enrollment limitations and a restrictive covenant recorded in Miami-Dade County public records, which governs aspects of its property use and development. Notably, the school is expanding its physical footprint by acquiring additional homes across from 1044 Coral Way, increasing its square footage.\n\nNeighborhood concerns have centered on the school’s impact on local traffic and parking, especially regarding the use and maintenance of swales—landscape features designed to manage stormwater runoff. The school has requested to retain staff-imposed conditions aimed at preventing parking violations while seeking to remove a condition that requires the adjacent church to landscape and maintain the swales extending from Coral Way to Andalusia. Recent swale improvements in the area are intended to address some of these parking and environmental issues.\n\nOverall, the school remains an active participant in community and city planning discussions, balancing its growth and operational needs with neighborhood concerns about parking, property use, and environmental maintenance.\",26\n529,SWALES,\"The landscaped swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia, subject to a landscaping and maintenance condition imposed on the church and other property owners as part of the Planning and Zoning Board approval.\nThe swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia, which were subject to a landscaping and maintenance condition imposed on the church and other property owners as part of the Planning and Zoning Board approval.\",8\n588,SWALE IMPROVEMENTS,Project involving swale improvements on the front of the property and expansion to Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia to prevent parking and other issues related to the school.,3\n674,SWALE,,4\n147,SECTION 62-330,A section of the city code referenced as part of the procedures the Planning and Zoning Board follows when reviewing the entire record after a public hearing.,1\n544,NEIGHBOR AT PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD,A neighbor who appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and contributed to the addition of a condition requiring the church to landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia.,1\n570,NON-OPERABLE FIXED WINDOWS CONDITION,Condition of approval requiring non-operable fixed windows on the façade facing the adjacent abutting neighbor to the east as part of the major amendment approval.,1\n635,SWALE IMPROVEMENT,,1\n553,ED DIAZ,\"Ed Diaz serves as the Chief Operating Officer at the school, where he plays a key role in managing operational concerns, particularly those involving parents.

It features a variety of recreational amenities, including a playground section, tennis courts, a pickleball court, and a dog park. The park also includes a small parking lot situated to the east, which supports visitors to the area. Recent improvements to Salvadore Park, such as the addition of new swings and enhanced recreational facilities, have contributed to increased neighborhood activity and community engagement. The park serves as a popular gathering place for children and local residents, fostering a sense of community. While the increased use of the park has led to heightened parking demand and some traffic congestion in the surrounding neighborhood, users of the dog park and pickleball facilities have been noted as not causing issues such as driveway blockages or swale maintenance problems. Overall, Salvadore Park plays an important role in providing recreational opportunities and supporting neighborhood vitality.\",7\n534,PARKING,\"Parking in Coral Gables has emerged as a significant and multifaceted issue affecting various parts of the community, including residential neighborhoods, commercial areas, and public institutions. General concerns revolve around illegal parking practices, particularly the use of swales—grassy strips between sidewalks and streets—for parking, which has raised neighborhood complaints due to its impact on aesthetics, safety, and property conditions. Residents have also expressed frustration over vehicles blocking driveways, further complicating local traffic flow and access.\n\nIn commercial districts, parking availability is a critical factor influencing business success and customer convenience. Adequate parking facilities are closely tied to walkability and visibility, both of which affect traffic patterns and the overall attractiveness of commercial zones. The lack of sufficient parking infrastructure in these areas has been noted as a barrier to economic vitality and pedestrian-friendly environments.\n\nA particularly pressing concern involves the parking situation related to a school occupying a property purchased in 2016. The school’s growth has intensified parking demand, leading to increased neighborhood impact and exacerbating issues such as parking on swales and overflow into residential streets. This has been a focal point of discussion during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, where stakeholders highlighted the need to balance school expansion with neighborhood quality of life. The school, along with nearby Salvadore Park and a local church, contributes to fluctuating parking pressures, especially during events and peak hours.\n\nTo address these challenges, various solutions have been proposed and partially implemented. These include the introduction of residential parking permits aimed at prioritizing neighborhood residents’ access to parking and discouraging non-resident parking in sensitive areas. Landscaping efforts have also been considered to deter parking on swales and improve the visual environment. Additionally, the school has taken steps to discourage parking on swales, reflecting a collaborative approach to mitigating the issue.\n\nOverall, parking in Coral Gables is a complex issue intersecting with urban planning, community well-being, and economic activity. It requires coordinated efforts among city officials, residents, businesses, and institutions to develop sustainable solutions that address illegal parking, enhance availability, and preserve neighborhood character while supporting commercial and educational growth.\",12\n618,COVENANT,\"Covenant refers to a legal agreement recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County that governs the use and expansion of property related to a school and the surrounding neighborhood homes. This covenant imposes specific restrictions on property modifications and expansions to ensure that any changes comply with agreed-upon terms. During a recent meeting, the covenant was referenced in discussions concerning these restrictions. It has been alleged that the school has violated the covenant through its recent property acquisitions and expansions, which may not align with the limitations set forth in the agreement.

For instance, it approved the proposed preschool building design after multiple evaluations, including Design Review Committee (DRC) meetings held in April and August, as well as neighborhood consultations. This reflects the Board’s commitment to incorporating community input and ensuring design quality.\n\nAdditionally, the Board reviewed and approved a new school building design following two meetings. During this process, it required the inclusion of windows on the eastern side of the building for aesthetic reasons. This decision notably overrode a prior condition from the 2001-2003 master plan, which had prohibited windows on that side to prevent an institutional appearance. The Board’s insistence on this design change highlights its authority to update and adapt architectural guidelines to contemporary standards and community preferences.\n\nOverall, the Board of Architects serves as a critical regulatory body that not only enforces architectural standards and covenant restrictions but also actively shapes the design and aesthetic outcomes of educational and religious buildings through a structured review and approval process.\",9\n620,CORDOVA SIDE,\"Cordova Side, a location referenced as having barren swale conditions and poor grass maintenance compared to the other side.\",1\n624,PASTOR,\"The pastor contacted in 2022 by the speakers to address neighborhood concerns, but no resolution was achieved.\",1\n625,DRIVEWAYS,\"Driveways in the neighborhood that are being blocked by various people, causing access issues as described by Mr. and Ms. Toyos.\",1\n626,PICKLEBALL COURTS,\"Pickleball courts located within Salvadore Park, mentioned as a place whose users are not responsible for driveway blocking or swale maintenance problems.\",1\n627,TENNIS COURTS,\"Tennis courts mentioned as part of the recreational facilities near the neighborhood, whose users are not responsible for the driveway blocking or swale issues.\",1\n628,NEIGHBORS BEHIND,\"Neighbors behind the speakers' property who have maintained their swale landscaping for over 20 years, serving as an example of proper maintenance.\",1\n629,MARY,\"Mary, a backdoor neighbor mentioned by Mr. Toyos in the context of swale and sidewalk maintenance.\",1\n630,ANDALUSIA CORNER,\"The corner of Andalusia street, location of a neighbor's driveway and landscaping efforts to prevent driveway blocking.\",1\n678,NEIGHBORHOOD,\"The neighborhood area was a focal point of discussion during the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where concerns were raised regarding the impact of parking and school-related issues on the community.
