The DRC acts as the primary governing body responsible for reviewing development proposals and major amendments to the Site Plan before permitting can proceed. The Site Plan defines the physical layout and boundaries of the school campus and is subject to public hearings and regulatory conditions.

Its responsibilities include evaluating various projects to ensure they meet established standards and guidelines, thereby maintaining the quality and consistency of community development. The DRC's authority extends to reviewing major amendments to the Site Plan, underscoring its critical role in overseeing significant changes to approved developments. For example, the committee reviewed the preschool building plans and project in April of the previous year, demonstrating its active involvement in specific development initiatives.

It clearly defines building sizes, property limits, and the overall layout of the campus. The Site Plan is not static; it is subject to a public hearing process and includes specific conditions that must be met to ensure compliance with regulatory and community standards.
