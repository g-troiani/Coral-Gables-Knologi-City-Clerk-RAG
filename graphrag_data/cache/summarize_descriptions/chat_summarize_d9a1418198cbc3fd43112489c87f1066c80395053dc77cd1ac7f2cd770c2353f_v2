The church is led by Mary Beth Conroy and is actively engaged in addressing local neighborhood concerns, particularly those related to high demand for parking and swale maintenance. St. Philip's works collaboratively with the City and nearby residents to find reasonable solutions that maintain community harmony. In addition to its religious functions, St. Philip's operates a nonprofit school in the area, which adheres to a student cap affidavit, ensuring that the student population remains stable without plans for expansion. Over the years, St. Philip's has also acquired several residential properties, including the home at 1100 Coral Way, which serves as a residence for the head of school and clergy rather than being used for classrooms or student activities. Overall, St. Philip's demonstrates a strong commitment to community involvement, responsible property management, and maintaining a balanced relationship with its neighbors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840846, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 522, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
