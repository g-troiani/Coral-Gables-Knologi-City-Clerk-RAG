I personally suggest don' t bring this back on second reading unless there' s a true agreement because we don' t want to repeat today.   And with regards to signage,  the residential permit,  I asked the City Manager,  that area does qualify for it, but again,  things have to be enforced and we all know because we have traffic circles,  we have speed bumps,  sometimes physical additions are required because people just regardless of what the sign says,  do whatever they want.   So, I'm in support of the direction my colleagues are headed with this first to second reading.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay,  so we can close this out between first and second,  if I'm getting the vibe of what this Commission is headed. So,  we' re going to move forward on first reading.   To move forward,  obviously,  we' re going to take a vote now.   What we' re requesting between first and second is -- okay, would you like to say something?\n\nMs. Russo:   No, no.\n\nMayor Lago:   No, I just want to make sure.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'm just acknowledging that we' re going to be meeting with the City Attorney and City Manager.\n\nMayor Lago:   What I would like is for there to be a meeting between the applicant and the City, the City Attorney,  City Manager,  and yourself,  if any other residents would like to join, to make sure that we address the issues with the swales.   What are we talking about?   A swale package of one form or another,  or what the Vice Mayor said in regards to the opportunity to address resident parking,  which has to be enforced.   Again,  that puts another burden of proof on you, because I'll tell you why.   Because you have to call --  if someone parks there,  you have to call and get it enforced.   When you have the swale package in place, you' re not calling anybody because no one, unless they' re, you know,  destructive individuals and they park over the swale package,  I don' t think many people are going to park over that.  At least in my yard, which I have the swale package, the ferns,  you can' t park on the swale.   There' s no opportunity.   But if you really wanted to, you could.  You would potentially get your car stuck in there.  So, my point is that we' re going to move forward between first and second reading,  but there will be a meeting where you will be there.  I'm also asking for the Manager and for his team to please pick a day that they do not notify the applicant during school hours to make sure that we visit and we understand exactly what' s happening,  either during drop-off and pickup,  to get a better understanding of where we are right now in regards to what they' re facing in that neighborhood.   Are there anything else that we need to add as requests between first and second?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   With those conditions,  I would move it.  You know, they need to have a meeting also with our staff to understand what the choices are on these residential parking permit signs because then you have a decal or a paper that goes in on the car and someone will be ticketed if you call if they park there without having that permit sign.  So, make sure you study your choices so you can make the best informed choice.   You know, everybody likes something different.   We don' t all like the same flavor of ice cream.   So, really,  the choice is in your --  on you.\n\nMayor Lago:   The goal...\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we didn' t want to be here.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But the reality is that we' ve reached out ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   I think I'm going to think the words out of your mouth.   The intent of today is to turn a new leaf and hopefully start building a relationship between the school and yourself that is something where you can become partners.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' re open to it.\n\nMayor Lago: Become partners because you' re not going anywhere, the school' s not going anywhere,  the park' s not going anywhere.   So, what we need to do is work together so that we just continue to advance quality of life in the neighborhood.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Agreed.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think Ms. Russo had a comment from a resident that you want to maybe deliver.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, that was Ed Diaz and I told him, he came up with an idea and I said let' s save that for when we all meet.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just wanted to make sure…\n\nMs. Russo:   Together.\n\nMayor Lago:   We put your idea on the record and please.\n\nMs. Russo:   He' s the chief operating officer, so he deals a lot with the parents and asking them\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-4<|>agenda_item<|>Agenda Item E-4, an ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip's School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre-K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida; all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>3576<|>ordinance<|>Ordinance No. 3576, which originally approved the St. Philip's School site plan that is being amended by Agenda Item E-4 to replace an existing building with a new pre-K building at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida; all other conditions of approval in this ordinance remain in effect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>meeting<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, during which Agenda Item E-4 was discussed and voted upon.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST_PHILIPS_SCHOOL<|>project<|>St. Philip's School, the subject of the site plan amendment under Agenda Item E-4 and Ordinance No. 3576, located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>person<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, facilitating discussion on Agenda Item E-4 and encouraging partnership between the school and neighborhood.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR_TUYOS<|>person<|>Mr. Tuyos, participant in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, engaging in dialogue about the school and neighborhood relations during discussion of Agenda Item E-4.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS_RUSSO<|>person<|>Ms. Russo, participant in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, acknowledging meetings with City Attorney and City Manager and relaying resident comments related to Agenda Item E-4.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-4<|>3576<|>Agenda Item E-4 amends the site plan originally approved by Ordinance No. 3576, explicitly linking these two legislative actions as related to the same project at St. Philip's School.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-4<|>ST_PHILIPS_SCHOOL<|>Agenda Item E-4 concerns the amendment of the St. Philip's School site plan, directly relating the agenda item to the project.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>3576<|>ST_PHILIPS_SCHOOL<|>Ordinance No. 3576 originally approved the St. Philip's School site plan, establishing a direct relationship between the ordinance and the project.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>E-4<|>Agenda Item E-4 was discussed and voted upon during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Mayor Lago presided over the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MR_TUYOS<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Mr. Tuyos participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, contributing to discussions related to Agenda Item E-4.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MS_RUSSO<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Ms. Russo participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, providing comments and relaying resident input related to Agenda Item E-4.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>MR_TUYOS<|>Mayor Lago and Mr. Tuyos engaged in dialogue about building a partnership between the school and neighborhood during the meeting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MS_RUSSO<|>MR_TUYOS<|>Ms. Russo referenced a resident's idea related to the school and neighborhood, which was acknowledged by Mr. Tuyos.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
