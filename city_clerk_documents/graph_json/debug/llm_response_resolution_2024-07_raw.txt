Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user specified to look through the entire document. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

Looking at the first page, there's a lot about the resolution regarding AT&T's maintenance contract, but no mention of an agenda item code yet. The sections go up to SECTION 3, and then there's the voting information. 

Wait, here on the second page, after the vote details, I see "AgendaItem: H-2)". That looks exactly like what they're asking for. The format is "AgendaItem: H-2", so the code is H-2. 

I should check if there's any other part of the document that mentions an agenda item, but scrolling through again, that's the only instance. The example responses show formats like H-1, so H-2 fits the required pattern. No other codes are present. The answer should be H-2.

AGENDA_ITEM: H-2
