The first action involves an ordinance amending the Cocoplum Phase 1 Security Guard District, originally established by Miami-Dade County under County Ordinance 95-214. This amendment, implemented through Ordinance 23-6723 and Ordinance 2024-01, expands the scope of security services within the district to include additional measures such as the installation of security cameras. The ordinance was sponsored by Commissioner Menendez and was discussed and approved during the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024. The motion to adopt the ordinance was moved by Commissioner Fernandez, seconded by Commissioner Anderson, and passed unanimously with a 5-0 vote by Commissioners Menendez, Anderson, Castro, Fernandez, and Lago. This amendment aims to enhance the safety and security of the Cocoplum Phase 1 community by broadening the range of security services provided under the special taxing district.\n\nThe second legislative action under Agenda Item E-1 pertains to amendments to the text of the City of Coral Gables Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Element. These amendments were made pursuant to expedited state review procedures outlined in Section 163.3184 of the Florida Statutes and Zoning Article 14, \"Process,\" Section 14-213, \"Comprehensive Plan Text and District regulations.\" The amendments clarify the designation of the Design & Innovation District as a Transfer codification and provide for an effective date. This action represents a readoption of Ordinance No. 2023-34 and is codified as Ordinance 23-5979 on second reading. The amendments include provisions allowing for additional building height up to 137 feet and 6 inches, contingent upon the inclusion of park incentives if developed pursuant to the Design & Innovation District of Development Rights receiving area. The ordinance also contains repealer and severability provisions to ensure legal clarity and enforceability.\n\nTogether, these two components of Agenda Item E-1 reflect the City Commissionâ€™s efforts to both enhance community security in the Cocoplum Phase 1 area and to advance urban development policies within the Coral Gables Comprehensive Plan, particularly regarding the Design & Innovation District. Both ordinances were formally adopted following thorough review and unanimous approval by the City Commission.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844107, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 458, "prompt_tokens": 854, "total_tokens": 1312, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
