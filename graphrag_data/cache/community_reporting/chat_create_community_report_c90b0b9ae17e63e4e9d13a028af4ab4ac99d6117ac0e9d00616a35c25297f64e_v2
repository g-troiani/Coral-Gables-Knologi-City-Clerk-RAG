Currently, the Metro Mover is undergoing a significant westward expansion toward Florida International University (FIU), representing one of the longest routes in its network. This expansion aims to improve regional connectivity and transit options, leveraging the system's speed and flexibility advantages. The project has secured funding commitments from the federal government (Washington), as well as support from county and Tallahassee officials, highlighting its importance in the broader transportation strategy.
