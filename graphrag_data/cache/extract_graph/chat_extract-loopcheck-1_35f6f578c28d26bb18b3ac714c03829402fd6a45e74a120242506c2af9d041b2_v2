I did have conversations with a few commercial real estate agents before putting this item on the agenda.  The general consensus I got from them --  and I know there are differing opinions because we have received some emails from realtors about this item -- but the general consensus was that they have not seen a lot of clients lately that have just been driving around the city or walking around looking for property.   Most commercial clients have a realtor that they' re familiar with or that they use, and they work with them to find the property.  So, the larger signs are not necessarily as important.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Throckmorton: Thank you,  Commissioner. So,  just to give a brief overview,  as you mentioned,  just to give us the specifics here,  actually,  currently signs in SFR, MF1,  MF2, MF3, and MF4 districts shall not be larger than 40 square inches with an additional\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nbottom sign with certain language.   And then signs in MX1, MX2, MX3 districts shall be no larger than 250 square inches.   So, this would change the requirement for those MX1, MX2, and MX3 districts from 250 inches down to the 40 square inches that is permitted in those more residential neighborhoods that we discussed.\n\nMayor Lago:   Would you like to hear public comment or would you likeâ€¦\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   For the Commission first?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Let' s go ahead and do public comment.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   First speaker\n\nis Sarah Hernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Chair, good to see you.\n\nSarah Hernandez: Thank you. Mr.  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  the Commissioners, thank you for allowing me to stay here today and give you the opinion of the business community as through the lens of the Chamber.   As you know, the Chamber only became aware of this ordinance late Friday. It has significantly hampered our ability to speak to our members and see how it' s going to affect their businesses. These include companies like the Allen Morris Company,  Terranova,  Davis &amp; Young,  as well as the Miami Association of Realtors,  the Commercial Alliance.   We believe we have previously addressed this issue for available retail space in our downtown area when we worked together with you over a year ago on the window wrap ordinance for leasable space.   That took into account the signage for the brokerage and the property owners as well.   We have also learned that the commercial brokers are required to list specific information on their signs,  and by reducing the signage from the 250 to the 40 is going to hamper their ability to stay in compliance with the DBPR.   Finally,  even in this day and age of leasing and selling commercial properties, it' s critical that available space be advertised in the window,  especially ground floor retail space. We spoke with our City consultant,  Midge McCauley,  who reiterated this need and the fact that the 250 square feet inches on these signs are small,  less obtrusive than you might see in other municipalities.   We would simply ask for more time to present to our Real Estate Committee and to our business members what the Commission is proposing and allow us to look at the pros and cons and work together to find a solution that would work for the City.  Of course,  we want the City to maintain and continue to be beautiful,  but we' d also like to make sure that we' re not impacting the economic engine,  which is the business community.   Thank you so much for your time, for listening to me, and for your consideration.   Thank you.\n\nCommissioner\n\nCastro:   Thank you.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-8 - Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables official Zoning Code,  amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107 ' Real Estate,  For Sale, Lease or Rental of Property or Buildings,' to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease, or rental of property or buildings in any use district.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Manny Chamizo.\n\nMayor Lago:   Good morning,  sir.\n\nManny Chamizo:   Good morning.
