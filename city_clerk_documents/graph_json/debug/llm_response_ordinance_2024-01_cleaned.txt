Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided ordinance document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by scanning the entire text provided. The document is Ordinance No. 2024-01 from the City of Coral Gables. The user mentioned that the code is usually something like E-2 or F-10. I need to look for any line that says "Agenda Item" followed by a code.

Looking at the document, the main body includes various WHEREAS clauses and sections. The end of the document has some signatures and votes. Let me check the very end. 

Here's the last part: 

"PASSED AND ADOPTED THIS NINTHDAYOFJANUARY, A.D., 2024.

Ah, here it is: "AgendaItem: E-1)". The phrase "AgendaItem:" is followed by "E-1". The format matches the examples given (like E-2 or F-10). The code is E-1. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the document again, I don't see any other references to an agenda item code. The only instance is that line right before the approvals. 

The user emphasized to return ONLY the code in the exact format AGENDA_ITEM: [code]. Since I found "E-1", that's the answer. If I missed it, but no, it's clearly there. So the correct response should be AGENDA_ITEM: E-1.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-1
