It holds public hearings on ordinances and amendments, with required public notice, and thoroughly reviews the entire record after these hearings in accordance with the city’s zoning code and relevant sections (62-328 and 62-330). Following its review, the board forwards recommendations to the City Commission for final decision-making.\n\nOn November 8, 2023, the Planning and Zoning Board held a meeting (documented as 23-6674, Agenda Items 1-3) during which it reviewed a major amendment to the 2002 site plan for St. Philip’s School. The board recommended approval of the proposed preschool building with three specific conditions: the windows must remain fixed and inoperative, all previous conditions including limits on the number of students must be maintained, and heavy landscaping must be applied to the front of the building. Additionally, the board required the church to landscape and maintain the swales on properties along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia. The board also requested an expansion of swale improvements in this area, reflecting its broader role in directing swale enhancements and addressing neighborhood concerns related to traffic, parking, and property maintenance.\n\nThe Planning and Zoning Board receives regular reports and recommendations from City staff, particularly as part of the Zoning in Progress Resolution process, which involves zoning moratoriums and related legislative matters. It serves as a key advisory body that ensures zoning and development proposals align with community standards and city regulations before they proceed to the City Commission.\n\nOverall, the Planning and Zoning Board functions as a critical intermediary in Coral Gables’ land use and development process, balancing regulatory compliance, neighborhood interests, and city planning objectives through its review, public hearings, and recommendations to the City Commission.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840821, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 379, "prompt_tokens": 750, "total_tokens": 1129, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
