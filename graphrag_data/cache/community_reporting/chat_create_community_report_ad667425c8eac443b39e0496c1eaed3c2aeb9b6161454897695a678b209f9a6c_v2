The Act also unlocks access to over $800 million in funding and requires parking reductions near major transit stops to encourage transit-oriented development.

These districts regulate height, density, and land use, but their local restrictions are preempted by the Live Local Act to allow the highest permissible building height within a one-mile radius. This zoning framework enables the integration of affordable housing within mixed-use environments, supporting a blend of residential, commercial, and innovative uses, particularly in the Design and Innovation District along U.S.-1.

The Development Review Committee (DRC) and the Board of Architects, Planning and Zoning are key city bodies involved in reviewing and approving developments over 20,000 square feet under the Act’s framework. These bodies ensure compliance with the new regulations while balancing urban planning goals. Smaller developments under 20,000 square feet bypass certain peer review processes, streamlining approvals under the Act.

Similarly, density limitations, including units per acre, are analyzed citywide rather than by local zoning constraints, enabling potentially higher residential densities to support affordable housing goals.
