Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user said it can be anywhere, so I have to check every page. Let me start skimming through the text.

Looking at the first part, there's the ordinance number and some sections being amended. Not seeing it yet. The WHEREAS clauses don't have it. Then in the sections, like SECTION 1, 2, etc., still no agenda item mentioned. 

Wait, near the end of the document, after the sections, there's a part with "PASSEDANDADOPTED THISNINTHDAYOFJANUARY, A.D., 2024." Then signatures. Then I see "AgendaItem: E-3)" right there on what looks like page 2. Let me check again. Yes, in the text: "AgendaItem: E-3)" 

Is there another one? Let me scan again. The same code appears again on page 3 of the ordinance, but the main occurrence is that "AgendaItem: E-3". The format matches the examples given, like Item E-3. So the code is E-3. I don't see any other codes. The user wants exactly how it's written, so E-3.

AGENDA_ITEM: E-3
