Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

To move forward,  obviously,  we' re going to take a vote now.   What we' re requesting between first and second is -- okay, would you like to say something?\n\nMs. Russo:   No, no.\n\nMayor Lago:   No, I just want to make sure.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'm just acknowledging that we' re going to be meeting with the City Attorney and City Manager.\n\nMayor Lago:   What I would like is for there to be a meeting between the applicant and the City, the City Attorney,  City Manager,  and yourself,  if any other residents would like to join, to make sure that we address the issues with the swales.   What are we talking about?   A swale package of one form or another,  or what the Vice Mayor said in regards to the opportunity to address resident parking,  which has to be enforced.   Again,  that puts another burden of proof on you, because I'll tell you why.   Because you have to call --  if someone parks there,  you have to call and get it enforced.   When you have the swale package in place, you' re not calling anybody because no one, unless they' re, you know,  destructive individuals and they park over the swale package,  I don' t think many people are going to park over that.  At least in my yard, which I have the swale package, the ferns,  you can' t park on the swale.   There' s no opportunity.   But if you really wanted to, you could.  You would potentially get your car stuck in there.  So, my point is that we' re going to move forward between first and second reading,  but there will be a meeting where you will be there.  I'm also asking for the Manager and for his team to please pick a day that they do not notify the applicant during school hours to make sure that we visit and we understand exactly what' s happening,  either during drop-off and pickup,  to get a better understanding of where we are right now in regards to what they' re facing in that neighborhood.   Are there anything else that we need to add as requests between first and second?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   With those conditions,  I would move it.  You know, they need to have a meeting also with our staff to understand what the choices are on these residential parking permit signs because then you have a decal or a paper that goes in on the car and someone will be ticketed if you call if they park there without having that permit sign.  So, make sure you study your choices so you can make the best informed choice.   You know, everybody likes something different.   We don' t all like the same flavor of ice cream.   So, really,  the choice is in your --  on you.\n\nMayor Lago:   The goal...\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we didn' t want to be here.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But the reality is that we' ve reached out ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   I think I'm going to think the words out of your mouth.   The intent of today is to turn a new leaf and hopefully start building a relationship between the school and yourself that is something where you can become partners.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' re open to it.\n\nMayor Lago: Become partners because you' re not going anywhere, the school' s not going anywhere,  the park' s not going anywhere.   So, what we need to do is work together so that we just continue to advance quality of life in the neighborhood.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Agreed.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think Ms. Russo had a comment from a resident that you want to maybe deliver.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, that was Ed Diaz and I told him, he came up with an idea and I said let' s save that for when we all meet.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just wanted to make sure…\n\nMs. Russo:   Together.\n\nMayor Lago:   We put your idea on the record and please.\n\nMs. Russo:   He' s the chief operating officer, so he deals a lot with the parents and asking them not to park on swales ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   We welcome all ideas between first and second.   So, I need a motion,  if I may.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I'll move it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Second.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes. Commissioner Castro:   Yes. Commissioner Fernandez:   Yes. Commissioner Menendez:   Yes. Mayor Lago:   Yes. Vote:  5-0)\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Do you know when this will be coming back,  Mr. Manager?   Do you know when this is coming back?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So, it'd be, I think, up to the applicant when they' re ready to come back, as long as we have time\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_810083d04ca8fb5efe7445795a1fd26ae2d2c1fac3e5c9c0c44cacee26b87670_v2"}
