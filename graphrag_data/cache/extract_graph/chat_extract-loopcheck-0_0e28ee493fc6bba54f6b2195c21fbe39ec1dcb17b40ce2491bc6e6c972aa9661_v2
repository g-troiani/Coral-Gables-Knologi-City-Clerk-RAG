Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

I will send you the link shortly to all of you,  so that you can see what we have up;  and obviously,  we are happy to make any changes that you would like, and if you would like us to put it in another location,  we can do that as well.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Can we put it on the Home Page?\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Pardon me.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Can we put it on the Home Page?\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  On the Home Page,  we can put it under News. We cannot put it as one of the five things, but we can put it definitely under the News section.\n\nMayor Lago:  Do we have a Burger Bob' s section right now?\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  No, we do not have.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm going to make it even easier.  What I would like to see is, for example,  we use a system in construction called Pro Core. We' re not going to put a Pro Core for access.  But what I would like to see is, there is going to be a link, drop box where people can go in there and see the schedule for the project,  construction,  and monthly update photos. Maybe we can put it on the first of every month,  we can have an updated schedule and we can have updated photos.  Maybe 10 or 15 and it can be just its own simple link and it says Burger Bob' s. That way you don' t need to have it on the Home Page,  you don' t need to have it on the Parks Page,  you don' t need to have it anywhere,  except for just on Burger Bob' s and it literally you' ll be updated like we do the first of every month.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  Commissioners,  the monthly update will be done very quickly,  as I mentioned,  the project manager is on vacation,  just got back today,  yesterday,  and then it will be updated very soon.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, can we have that, can we have that done?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Yes Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  And one more request.  Just have them test it in the search bar. You put in Burger Bob' s it can link right to it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Perfect.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You said that you were going to send us a link, right.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  I will.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  Can you take a moment and sit with Mr. Wells and show him how to go into that link. You said there' s already a schedule up.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Yes. It's under Parks Projects and Updates.  So, I will definitely let Mr. Wells know and I will send it to all of you in case you get any other questions.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you, Ms. Pantin.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There is a link on the city' s Home Page for current projects,  correct, general construction projects,  there was.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCommunications Director Pantin: For general construction projects, but those are Planning Projects,  these are not city projects.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  But I thought we had added city projects to that.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  I think they are from - I don' t want to speculate here,  because I'm not exactly sure.  I do believe that they are for sort of bigger projects,  general projects,  but we' ll definitely look into it and see what we can do.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: Okay.  If that already exists,  if we could add it to that as well,  I'll appreciate it.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you, Ms. Pantin.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY_OF_CORAL_GABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The
