Identify all entities.

And then if you go to Bird Road,  the Highway Department has another one entirely which we don' t have a picture.  I could go on and on and on. We' ve got lots of these things. But the really cool thing is, when you walk it, when you cross that line from wherever it is, from Dade County or the City of Miami or South Miami, and you come here to this special place, its street jewelry embraces you.  If you would go to the next,  please.  We have a new monument that we' ve put in. We' ve put in the black lights,  nobody really thought about that.  And then we have these other kind of street poles I really like. Those are the ones that should be fixed and there' s quite a few like those ones without hats or ones that are broken,  or they are severely tilted over.  So,  if you would please.  So really,  this is not just about history,  it' s about brand and urban design.  It' s about how we want our city to be and we' re going to talk about this a little bit further, and I highly recommend to the board and I will do it again when I read the resolution that we take a look at this and we do it in a deliberate way, that we take this opportunity to not only continue to brand and make our city great, but also to come up with standards that make it easy for us to not only identify where we are in the community.  No other city, no other area in South Florida has streetlights like we do,  nor the color that we have.  We are unique.  So,  with that I'd really recommend considering this and I look forward to speaking with you again about this issue shortly.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nThank you very much for your attention and thank you for anything.  If you have a question,  I'm happy to answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  I just wanted to say thank you for putting that together.  It took a lot of work. I know you take your time to really make sure you drove home the point of the importance of restoring and reviving our history.  I think we are going to go over it a few times. I think there are two items on the Commission that we' ll hear together that address this issue and I welcome you to come back again.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  I think you' ll notice also from the Commission;  I think we are all on the same page in regard to what we want to see. I just think that we need to bring FPL, which is my understanding that FPL will be attending the next Commission meeting to have a conversation in regard to what can we do to get a little bit of uniformity as we address lights moving forward.  You brought up something that I hadn' t thought about, I think is a great idea is the issue,  as developers continue to build throughout this community in one form or another or we invest in this community,  there should be uniformity on that front,  even if it' s something that' s existing,  we should like we' re doing with the White Way Lights.  We just got back ten,  I was there the other day when they brought them in, and we' re going to get about another eight that are in really good shape that are actually working.  So those again will be refurbished,  and they' ll be put somewhere prominently wherever the Historic Preservation and the Manager deem appropriate, and I think that' s something in the works that shows our commitment.  Now the issue is the standard lights that we really need to focus on and see how we can achieve the goal because the costs are pretty significant.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Mayor,  one of the things that I really enjoy about FPL and I do enjoy FPL, I think it' s a wonderful company and they' ve really proven that they are good community citizens,  but you know I want to bring your attention back to a few years ago when FPL said that it was going to cost $30,000 a house to underground,  and how in recent past, not too long ago, its now not going to cost anything.  So, you know, these things have a way of not only working themselves out, but to the benefit of the entire community making it better.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Mayor Lago:  I think to your point,  and you bring a very good point.  I worked with the Manager for years meeting with the President of FPL on multiple occasions,  to see how we can bridge the gap that we wouldn' t have to go to a referendum vote and have to spend close to, I think it was 275 million dollars to underground here in the city, and we found a way, a compromise and we got that project started last year, and its something that hopefully over the next 10 or 15 years we' ll significantly revamp our infrastructure here in the city. Not only revamp it,  but also make it more redundant and beautify the city,  especially our tree canopy which in some areas is killed or destroyed as a result of power lines that run through them.  So, I agree with you. I just think that this is a process that we have to be honest with ourselves.  It's going to take time. For example,  the White Way Lights that we' re refurbishing now, we had to take out, I think it was a little over $ 2 million dollars from Art in Public Places,  which again,  was something that I didn' t want to do,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CALLE OCHO<|>PROJECT<|>Calle Ocho, a street referenced as part of the City of Coral Gables' urban environment and street design context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIRD ROAD<|>PROJECT<|>Bird Road, a location mentioned in relation to the Highway Department's street infrastructure within the City of Coral Gables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City of Coral Gables, a municipal organization responsible for urban design, street lighting, and infrastructure projects discussed in the meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, where topics including street lighting, urban design, and infrastructure projects were discussed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK LIGHTS<|>PROJECT<|>Newly installed black lights in the City of Coral Gables, described as a new monument and part of the city's street jewelry and urban design efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STREET POLES<|>PROJECT<|>Street poles in the City of Coral Gables, some of which are broken, tilted, or missing hats, identified as needing repair or replacement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE WAY LIGHTS<|>PROJECT<|>The White Way Lights, a historic street lighting project in the City of Coral Gables currently undergoing refurbishment, with about ten recently returned and eight more in good working condition to be refurbished and prominently displayed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FPL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Florida Power & Light (FPL), an energy company involved in discussions with the City of Coral Gables regarding street lighting uniformity, undergrounding power lines, and infrastructure improvements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ART IN PUBLIC PLACES FUND<|>MONEY<|>A funding source from which a little over $2 million was allocated to refurbish the White Way Lights in the City of Coral Gables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the mayor of the City of Coral Gables, who spoke about the importance of restoring history, urban design, and infrastructure projects including street lighting and collaboration with FPL.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
