It defines the purpose, applicability, and specific mandates for utility line installations underground, including amendments that refine publication requirements. This section directly governs the Underground Utilities Requirement, linking legal compliance to practical infrastructure mandates. Its role is pivotal in shaping the community's regulatory environment and ensuring that utility installations meet city standards for safety and aesthetics [Data: Entities (72), Relationships (405)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Comprehensive Underground Utilities Requirement\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Underground Utilities Requirement mandates that all utility lines, including electrical power distribution, telephone, communication, street lighting, and video service lines, be installed underground. This requirement aims to enhance reliability, public safety, tree preservation, business continuity, and city aesthetics. It applies broadly to utility infrastructure but explicitly exempts city-owned network infrastructure and electrical transmission lines.

These lines are generally required to be installed underground to meet safety and aesthetic goals. However, certain categories such as electrical transmission lines and city-installed utility lines and poles are exempt from these requirements. This categorization clarifies the scope of the undergrounding mandate and ensures that exemptions are well-defined to accommodate technical and operational constraints [Data: Entities (350, 369, 370, 371, 372), Relationships (412, 413, 414, 415)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Exemptions for City-Owned Infrastructure\",\n      \"explanation\": \"City-owned network infrastructure and city-installed utility lines and poles are explicitly exempt from the underground utilities requirement.
