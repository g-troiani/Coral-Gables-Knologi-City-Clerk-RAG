It is closely linked to other community concerns such as parking structure proposals and traffic management. The Planning and Zoning Board meeting minutes discuss this package, indicating its formal consideration in city governance. The package’s legislative nature and its connection to parking regulations suggest it is a key factor in managing neighborhood infrastructure and mitigating issues arising from increased school activities and property use changes.

This expansion has raised significant concerns about potential violations of existing legal covenants governing the school’s property use. The School Covenant, recorded in Miami-Dade County public records, explicitly governs these property and expansion activities. The expansion’s potential to contravene these covenants has been a focal point of community debate and legal scrutiny, highlighting the tension between development goals and neighborhood legal frameworks.

However, these recommendations were reportedly not followed by the city, leading to resident dissatisfaction and ongoing problems. This disconnect between advisory bodies and city action has contributed to community frustration and complicates efforts to resolve infrastructural and legal challenges.
