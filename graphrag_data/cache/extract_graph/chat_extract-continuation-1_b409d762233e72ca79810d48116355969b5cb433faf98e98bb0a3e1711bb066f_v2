Let' s test the waters with the employees,  okay.  The employees still vote one way,  we' re going to vote against the employees. For example,  the same thing we were talking about the possibility of doing November elections on -  let' s do November elections,  let' s get the pulse of the community and let' s vote on it. Now we don' t want to vote on it. To me, I just think that it's - you may want that, and I understand that, but at the end of the day, the employees who are the ones being recognized are the ones saying we prefer to be in the Commission Chambers.  Honor our request.  If it was the other way around,  205 people were against it, I'd say listen,  let' s move forward with what the employee wants.  I don' t have an issue with it. It's not the first time that we changed gears on issues,  but I just think, with all due respect,  I think it's more agenda- driven than it is actually driven to benefit the employees.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  I commend you for bringing this back. Thank you very much. I thought this was a lost item. I sincerely think that the way that the survey was worded was not the best outcome, because I don' t think the words,  the questions were to really make the employees understand that this was something special for them and as far as me, I could pledge to be there every single time in any award ceremony, so that makes it any more special. I don' t know if the rest of the\n\nCommission is going to be there. I'm pretty sure most of us will be there and it will be even more special.  So, with all my heart I support this.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  My question is for the administration for the Clerk' s office,  because I think this occurred,  this issue came up because right after the elections we were having an hourand-a-half,  two-hour presentations in protocol section and it was meeting after meeting after meeting,  and we were here 9, 10, 11 hours at the end of the day, and how can -  I'm looking for solutions.  How can we better manage that situation.  Are we the only city that has protocols before the Commission meetings?  Do some have it at noon? I'm looking for something other than one or the other. Is there a hybrid? - because an hour-and- a-half, two hours which everybody is deserving, the people that are recognized,  obviously today was a perfect example,  but why are we having an hour-and-a-half to two-hour protocols when there are folks with items that we need to get to.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And to answer your question,  Commissioner,  this would still allow for certain items to come before the Commission on the date. This would not preclude us from having presentations and protocols during this meeting.  It would move so that items that are known to be at a certain time and our recognition of our employees to have a special ceremony to recognize them.  So, it is a hybrid which we worked out from the conversations that came about during our initial Commission meeting.  Originally,  the resolution that I had presented was everything would be moved to this ceremony.  This is more of a hybrid based on the input that was gathered during the Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Commissioner Menendez,  I want to give you another opportunity.  Excuse me.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You' re a little funny sometimes but continue.  Another opportunity.  Go. I'm listening.\n\nMayor Lago:  Another opportunity to kind of see it another way.  When Mayor Valdes- Fauli was here,  we used to start the Commission meeting earlier and it was seamless,  and it wasn' t an issue. We had it downstairs.  I think people enjoyed it. It wasn' t an issue. We started 30-45 minutes early. We got here probably at 9:15 and we moved forward pretty quickly.  For some reason I thought that maybe being outside pushed the protocol documents faster,  maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like it was kind of a much faster process.  I said,  let' s get here earlier and let' s get it done.  I'm more than willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning,  at 8:30, get it done,  and we meet the goals of the employees who they stated very clearly by the poll that we took that they would rather have it here and we meet the goal of getting here as quickly as possible and the residents can get here at 9 o' clock, 9:15, to have their items heard in a timely manner without any delays from the protocol section of the meeting.  Does that opportunity work for you?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s definitely one option.  I know we discussed that when this first came up.  Other than presentations and obviously the recognition,  Employee of the Month,  its September so we' re recognizing, is there a way to manage how many protocol items are per Commission meeting?  Can we cap it a little bit better because if you look at it, there are months\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nthat we have an hour-and-a-half, two hours, and then there are other meetings that we have, we' re done in 40 minutes or 35 minutes\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the mayor presiding over the City Commission meeting, actively participating in discussions about meeting protocols and employee recognition ceremonies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, a member of the City Commission who supports the employee recognition ceremony and appreciates the efforts to bring back the agenda item)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a member of the City Commission focused on managing meeting protocols and seeking solutions to reduce lengthy protocol sections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a member of the City Commission who proposed a resolution to create a hybrid approach for employee recognition ceremonies and protocol presentations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION CEREMONY<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Employee Recognition Ceremony, an agenda item discussing the timing and format of ceremonies to honor employees, including preferences for location and duration)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEETING PROTOCOLS<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Meeting Protocols, an agenda item addressing the scheduling and length of protocol presentations before City Commission meetings, with concerns about lengthy sessions and possible hybrid solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting, the official meeting of the city commission where discussions about employee recognition ceremonies and meeting protocols are held)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYBRID APPROACH<|>RESOLUTION<|>Hybrid Approach Resolution, a resolution proposed by Commissioner Fernandez to allow a combination of employee recognition ceremonies and protocol presentations during City Commission meetings to better manage time and meet employee preferences)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION CEREMONY<|>Mayor Lago discusses the importance of honoring employee preferences for the recognition ceremony location and timing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER CASTRO<|>EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION CEREMONY<|>Commissioner Castro supports the employee recognition ceremony and pledges personal attendance, emphasizing its importance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>MEETING PROTOCOLS<|>Commissioner Menendez raises concerns about the length of meeting protocols and seeks solutions to better manage them<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>HYBRID APPROACH<|>Commissioner Fernandez proposed the hybrid approach resolution to balance employee recognition and protocol presentations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYBRID APPROACH<|>EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION CEREMONY<|>The hybrid approach resolution modifies the format of the employee recognition ceremony to coexist with protocol presentations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYBRID APPROACH<|>MEETING PROTOCOLS<|>The hybrid approach resolution addresses the scheduling and duration of meeting protocols to improve efficiency<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION CEREMONY<|>The employee recognition ceremony is an agenda item discussed during the City Commission meeting<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING PROTOCOLS<|>Meeting protocols are discussed as part of the City Commission meeting agenda to improve meeting efficiency<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
