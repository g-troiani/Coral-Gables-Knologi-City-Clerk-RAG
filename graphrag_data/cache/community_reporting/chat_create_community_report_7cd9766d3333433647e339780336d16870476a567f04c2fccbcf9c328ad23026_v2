Riparian Property Owners, defined as those owning property within 1,000 feet of proposed dredging and filling work, are notified through courtesy notices and public hearing notices to ensure their participation and awareness. The Public Hearing entity represents formal meetings held by various city boards and commissions to review applications and proposals, including those related to dredging and filling activities. The Public Hearing Notice is a critical communication tool that mandates publication and mailing of notices to affected property owners within a specified radius. The relationships among these entities establish a structured framework for transparency, legal compliance, and community involvement in municipal decision-making.\",\n  \"rating\": 6.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderately high due to the community's role in ensuring legal compliance and public participation in environmental and municipal planning processes, which can significantly affect property rights and local governance.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Riparian Property Owners are key stakeholders in environmental and municipal planning\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Riparian Property Owners are individuals or entities owning property adjacent to or near water bodies, specifically within 1,000 feet of proposed dredging and filling work. Their identification is based on the latest city tax rolls, ensuring that notifications reach the correct parties. These owners receive courtesy notices informing them about proposed activities and upcoming public hearings, allowing them to participate in discussions or raise concerns about potential impacts on their properties and the environment.

Additionally, notices may be mailed to riparian property owners within 1,000 feet of the project site, ensuring that those most affected receive direct communication.

These owners are identified based on the latest city tax rolls and are notified through courtesy notices. The notifications inform them about the proposed dredging and filling activities as well as upcoming public hearings related to permit applications for such work. This process ensures that riparian property owners are kept informed and have the opportunity to participate in discussions or raise concerns regarding the impact of the proposed activities on their properties and the surrounding environment.\",3\n56,PUBLIC HEARING,\"A PUBLIC HEARING is a duly advertised meeting conducted by various city authorities, including the Planning and Zoning Board, City Commission, and Historic Preservation Board, to review and consider applications, proposals, and matters related to city planning, zoning, construction, and public services. These hearings serve as formal opportunities for public input and transparency in municipal decision-making processes.\n\nWhen conducted by the Planning and Zoning Board, a public hearing involves reviewing the entire record of an application in accordance with the zoning code and specific sections (62-328 and 62-330). This review is often part of the site plan review and approval process, ensuring compliance with local regulations.\n\nThe City Commission holds public hearings to authorize the construction, modification, or operation of enumerated city facilities. Such hearings require public notice, typically published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the meeting. Additionally, courtesy notices may be mailed to nearby property owners, and signs may be posted on the affected property to inform the community.\n\nPublic hearings by the City Commission also address ordinances, zoning amendments, and other city matters, with public notice provided through publication and/or mail to ensure community awareness and participation. Specific hearings include those for dredging and filling work, which follow an investigation and recommendation by the director of the public works department. These require at least 15 days' published notice and courtesy mailings to riparian property owners within 1,000 feet of the proposed work, allowing affected parties to voice support or concerns before the permit is approved or denied.\n\nIn matters related to public utilities, a public hearing is mandated before fixing rates, fees, or charges for the sewage disposal system. This hearing allows all users and interested parties to be heard regarding proposed changes, ensuring fair and transparent rate-setting.\n\nAdditionally, under Section 166.0451 of the Florida Statutes, the governing body of the municipality must hold a public hearing to review the inventory list of city-owned real property deemed appropriate for affordable housing, facilitating community involvement in housing policy decisions.\n\nThe Historic Preservation Board and City Commission also conduct public hearings to consider requests such as Special Certificates of Appropriateness or Government Settlement reviews. These hearings require advance publication and posting of notices to inform the public and solicit input.\n\nOverall, PUBLIC HEARINGS are essential components of municipal governance, providing structured forums for public participation, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making across a wide range of city functions and projects.\",10\n425,APPLICATIONS NOT LISTED,Applications that are not included in the public notice requirements table and therefore do not have public hearing notice requirements.,1\n255,PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE,\"The PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE is a formal announcement required by the City in accordance with applicable Florida Statute requirements and local regulations.
