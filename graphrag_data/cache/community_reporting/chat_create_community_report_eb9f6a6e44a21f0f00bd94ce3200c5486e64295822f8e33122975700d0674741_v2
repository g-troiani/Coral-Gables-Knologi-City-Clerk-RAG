General concerns revolve around illegal parking practices, particularly the use of swales—grassy strips between sidewalks and streets—for parking, which has raised neighborhood complaints due to its impact on aesthetics, safety, and property conditions. Residents have also expressed frustration over vehicles blocking driveways, further complicating local traffic flow and access.\n\nIn commercial districts, parking availability is a critical factor influencing business success and customer convenience. Adequate parking facilities are closely tied to walkability and visibility, both of which affect traffic patterns and the overall attractiveness of commercial zones. The lack of sufficient parking infrastructure in these areas has been noted as a barrier to economic vitality and pedestrian-friendly environments.\n\nA particularly pressing concern involves the parking situation related to a school occupying a property purchased in 2016. The school’s growth has intensified parking demand, leading to increased neighborhood impact and exacerbating issues such as parking on swales and overflow into residential streets. This has been a focal point of discussion during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, where stakeholders highlighted the need to balance school expansion with neighborhood quality of life. The school, along with nearby Salvadore Park and a local church, contributes to fluctuating parking pressures, especially during events and peak hours.\n\nTo address these challenges, various solutions have been proposed and partially implemented. These include the introduction of residential parking permits aimed at prioritizing neighborhood residents’ access to parking and discouraging non-resident parking in sensitive areas. Landscaping efforts have also been considered to deter parking on swales and improve the visual environment. Additionally, the school has taken steps to discourage parking on swales, reflecting a collaborative approach to mitigating the issue.\n\nOverall, parking in Coral Gables is a complex issue intersecting with urban planning, community well-being, and economic activity.
