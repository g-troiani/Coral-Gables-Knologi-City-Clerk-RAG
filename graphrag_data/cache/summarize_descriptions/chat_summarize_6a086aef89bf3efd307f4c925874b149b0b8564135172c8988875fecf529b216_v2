It requires the city to consider parking reductions within a half-mile radius of such developments, establishing specific criteria for these reductions based on proximity to transit and the size of the property. Additionally, the Act preempts local zoning regulations related to use, density, and height, effectively overriding traditional approval processes. Notably, it automatically approves building heights up to the maximum height allowed within one mile of the development site. By simplifying and standardizing regulations on parking, density, height, and land use near transit hubs, the Live Local Act promotes transit-oriented development and supports more efficient urban growth in Coral Gables.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840855, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
