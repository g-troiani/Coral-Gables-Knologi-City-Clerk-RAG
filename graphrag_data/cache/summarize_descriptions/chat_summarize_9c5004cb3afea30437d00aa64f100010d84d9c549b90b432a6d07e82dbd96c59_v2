It plays a key role in addressing issues related to parking, neighborhood concerns, and property management, particularly in relation to local schools. The board has actively engaged with both the school and neighborhood representatives, encouraging cooperation to develop solutions such as swale packages aimed at mitigating parking problems and improving neighborhood conditions.\n\nIn its regulatory capacity, the Planning and Zoning Board has reviewed site plan amendments and new building projects, recommending approval while imposing specific conditions to ensure community and environmental standards are met. For example, in November, the board recommended approval of a site plan amendment with conditions including the installation of non-operable fixed windows, swale improvements, and adherence to existing conditions and landscaping requirements. Additionally, the board has been involved in reviewing and recommending expansions of swale improvements along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia to prevent parking and related issues affecting the school and surrounding neighborhood.\n\nOverall, the Planning and Zoning Board serves as a critical city committee that facilitates communication between stakeholders, enforces planning regulations, and promotes improvements that balance development with community and environmental concerns.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749234348, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 235, "prompt_tokens": 343, "total_tokens": 578, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
