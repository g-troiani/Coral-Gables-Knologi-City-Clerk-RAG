I think live oaks;  he was talking about the two-degree temperature change would probably kill off most of our live oak trees.  So,  I just wanted to put that on everybody' s radar and maybe have the city have a conversation with Dr. Feely and make sure that if we are changing and doing a tree succession that we do take into account potential changes to temperature to make sure that five or ten years down the road if we do have an impact of a couple of years of two-degree or three-degree change to our temperature,  we don' t lose a lot of our tree canopy.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you respond,  could you give us a little bit of background in regard to the existing tree replacement program that we' ve had going on for the last,  I don' t know,  almost a decade.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Absolutely. Hello Commission, Mayor,  I'm Deena BellLlewelyn,  Greenspace Management from Public Works, for the record. Our current tree succession project we launch every year, we have a Commission- fed budget of $200,000 per year for that tree succession project every year.  Right now, there' s 2023 project is coming out of Procurement.  We intend to award it to the contractor,  hopefully within the next week or two to start replanting 111 total trees,  as part of this year' s project,  and as soon as we finish this one,  we roll right into next year where we already have hopefully 90 to 100 trees ready to plan.  We put this out to bid with contractors,  because the size of the project is large.  So, it buys about 100 trees a year on average.\n\nMayor Lago:  And if you go right now to, I was there last week,  if you go to our Public Works Department where the actual yard, you' ll get to see a lot of the oak trees that are basically ready to be transplanted from that office to the area where they are going to be relocated forever in the city. So, you can see all the trees are basically ready there for the contractor to take them to plant them somewhere in the neighborhoods.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Right. And in our Public Works yard we have about 40 oaks. We' re trying to green them up with more water before we plant them.  They dropped all their leaves,  and they are a little brown for our taste, so we' re waiting for them to green up.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  I used to do that by sinking them in six inches of water or more,  because they can tolerate about six weeks'  worth of being in standing water,  any of the ones that went into shock and then I would see the growth,  but right now they are dropping their leaves anyway.
