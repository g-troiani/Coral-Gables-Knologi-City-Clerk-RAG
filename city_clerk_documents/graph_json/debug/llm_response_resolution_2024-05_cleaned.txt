Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to search the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by reading through the document carefully. The document is Resolution No. 2024-05 from the City of Coral Gables. The main body talks about a pilot program for setting presentation and protocol items at certain times during the City Commission meetings. The resolution has several sections (1 to 4) detailing the directives.

Looking through each section, I don't see an agenda item code mentioned in the WHEREAS clauses or the sections. The user emphasized searching the entire document, so I need to check every part, including the footer or any notes at the end. 

Scrolling to the end of the document, after the sections, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: F-10)" right before the signatures and other details like the DocuSign ID. That looks like the agenda item code. The format matches the examples given (e.g., F-10). 

I should make sure there's no other code mentioned elsewhere. The rest of the document includes the mayor's approval, city clerk's attestation, and legal approval, but no other agenda item numbers. The key here is that the line "AgendaItem: F-10" is present towards the end. 

The user wants only the code, so I need to extract "F-10" and present it as AGENDA_ITEM: F-10. I must ensure there's no extra text or explanations, just the code as specified. Since the example includes hyphens, I should keep the hyphen in "F-10". 

Double-checking the document text again confirms that "AgendaItem: F-10" is the only instance. No other codes are present. Therefore, the correct answer is F-10.


AGENDA_ITEM: F-10
