The school is closely linked to several properties it owns, including the Coral Way and Cordova property and the residence at 1100 Coral Way, which serves clergy and school leadership. Key operational aspects such as student limits and drop-off procedures are regulated under conditions established during a master plan process from 2001 to 2003.

It underwent a comprehensive master plan process between 2001 and 2003, which imposed several operational and physical conditions to ensure compatibility with the surrounding residential neighborhood. These conditions include limiting the student population to 180, regulating drop-off operations, landscaping requirements, and special event permits. The school operates 172 days per year and is located immediately north of Salvadore Park, which affects local neighborhood activity and parking demand.

Parents enter the drop-off area from east to west, dropping children on the sidewalk side to ensure safety and efficiency. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the front area was temporarily graveled to facilitate drop-off, but this gravel will be removed post-construction and replaced with heavy landscaping to maintain aesthetic and environmental standards.
