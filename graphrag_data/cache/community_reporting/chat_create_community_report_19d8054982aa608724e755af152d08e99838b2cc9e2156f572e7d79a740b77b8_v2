Key entities include Pole Owners, Attaching Entities, and City regulatory mechanisms such as Permits, Code Enforcement Violations, and Fines. Pole Owners are responsible for notifying Attaching Entities and the city when undergrounding projects create redundant poles, which must be removed within 90 days. Attaching Entities must coordinate removal of their attachments from redundant poles and comply with payment obligations for use of private easements or city property. Noncompliance triggers code enforcement violations, fines, and potential denial of permits, all governed under section 101-137 of the city code.

They must also remove these redundant poles within 90 days of conversion to avoid code enforcement violations. This responsibility places Pole Owners at the core of compliance efforts, as their timely actions directly affect the obligations of Attaching Entities and the city's regulatory enforcement.

Failure to do so constitutes a code enforcement violation under section 101-137, resulting in daily accruing fines. Additionally, Attaching Entities must make payments to the city for continued use of private easements or city property when poles are conveyed or transferred.
