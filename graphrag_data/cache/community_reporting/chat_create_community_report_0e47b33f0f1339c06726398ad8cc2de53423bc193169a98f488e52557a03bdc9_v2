It influences business location decisions and is linked to the effectiveness of commercial signage, as noted by Manny Chamizo. Residential areas near schools face challenges from parents parking in swale and driveway areas, which has prompted active involvement from schools and residents to mitigate conflicts through communications and specific conditions. Additionally, parking requirements under the Live Local Act are a key zoning consideration that directly impacts the scale and density of development projects. These requirements also regulate parking pedestals, which affect building height and urban form. Neighborhood tensions persist around parking use, including swale utilization and residential permit programs designed to manage conflicts between residents and businesses.
