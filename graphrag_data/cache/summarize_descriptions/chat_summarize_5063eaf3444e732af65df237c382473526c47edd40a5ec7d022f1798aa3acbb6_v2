It plays a significant role in business location decisions, as highlighted by Manny Chamizo, who also connects parking availability to the effectiveness of commercial signage. In residential areas near schools, parking challenges arise from parents parking in swale and driveway areas, prompting the school and nearby residents to address these concerns through communications and specific conditions to mitigate conflicts.\n\nIn Coral Gables, parking requirements are an important zoning consideration that directly influence the scale and density of development projects. These requirements are reviewed by the City Commission under the Live Local Act, which includes regulations on parking pedestals that affect building height and overall urban form. Neighborhoods experience ongoing tensions related to parking use, including the utilization of swales and the implementation of residential permit programs designed to manage conflicts between residents and businesses.\n\nOverall, parking remains a central and complex issue involving multiple stakeholders, regulatory frameworks, and community concerns, impacting commercial viability, residential quality of life, and urban planning decisions in Coral Gables.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762933, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 497, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
