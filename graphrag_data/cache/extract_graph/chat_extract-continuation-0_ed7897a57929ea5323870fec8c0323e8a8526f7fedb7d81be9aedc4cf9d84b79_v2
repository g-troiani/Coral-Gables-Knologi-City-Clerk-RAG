strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

One of the challenges that one of our residents has met is he put in landscaping and still, you know, people don' t care and they roll over it because it' s not their property.   So,  once upon a time,  we required FP&amp; L and Comcast to put plantings around their boxes.  Slowly but surely, that has come and rests upon the shoulders of the residents. I think if you want a planted swale,  you need to make some decisions on what you want,  because you' re going to have to maintain it.   Because if you don' t irrigate it,  you can' t expect it to live.  So, take a look at the residential parking permit program.   The residential parking permit signs are much,  much prettier.   Each one of us gets some emails from particular residents that don' t like parking signs.  They consider them ugly.  Why do we need all the signs?  We have sign pollution. But the ones that are residential parking permit are green poles,  extruded,  and a much nicer sign and blend in with the community and don' t upset some of those other residents we have in Coral Gables that don' t like ' No Parking' signs.   They call it sign pollution and they want to take the signs out.  In fact, in my neighborhood I'm getting a list of all the ' No Parking'  signs from all the neighbors that want them out so I can just have staff come out one time.  And --  but I would like staff to come out there and help advise between parking programs available. I can tell you the folks that face the Salvadore dog park, we had a long discussion about it.   I told them the options and they said if the parking became an issue on their side,  that they were going to go with the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential parking permit.   That was their choice.   And in closing,  I'll give you the history of the word swale.   I know it's funny.   It's a funny word.   I thought it was funny because no one else spoke it except for me at one point in time until I moved into Coral Gables.   And I learned that the etymology of it, at least locally here in the United States,  came from Pittsburgh.   And it's not a hidden fact that George Merrick came from the Pittsburgh area, the Philadelphia area.   And that is a word that was brought over from, you know, UK English descent type word.  So, you won' t find it heavily used outside of Coral Gables. It was transplanted here from the Northeast and they called it Pittsburgh- ese.   You can look at --  get a dictionary of Pittsburgh- ese and find it.  Soâ€¦\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Anybody else?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I do have a couple of comments. I'm in the area quite a bit during pickup and drop-off.  And I have to agree,  during drop-off, the park should not be an issue.   The park is not heavily used at drop-off time.  During pickup,  I do see your argument that the park is heavily used in the afternoon.   A lot of parents pick up their children from other schools and bring them to the park.   I think that' s something that as we continue to renovate our City parks and improve the City parks in other areas,  including Phillips Park,  hopefully beginning next year,  we will see some shift in that use,  but it is something that must be addressed. Because just seeing your pictures,  I've seen the cars parking in the swale every morning,  and I've seen the effect that it has on residences. Like Vice Mayor Anderson stated,  I myself have been a victim of people parking and blocking my driveway on a regular basis because of a business at the end of my block. So, I have seen that impact,  and in some cases,  we' ve tried to get the people to move and they just refused to do so.   We' ve had to call the police in order to get them out and remove them from blocking driveways.   What I would have liked to have seen prior to this is some sort of resolution between the school and the neighbors,  instead of having to get to this point where now we' re basically airing the neighborhood laundry here in the City Commission.   Between first and second reading,  like the Mayor said,  I think there needs to be a sit down and some sort of resolution between both sides on something that will work going forward.   If the plans are to expand,  I do have concerns because there is no parking there and that will be something that must be addressed. But I think the Mayor brought up a very good point of including the Manager in this conversation and the City Attorney,  because I think it' s also encumbered upon us in the City if we have made all these improvements on Salvadore Park,  that we are not creating more problems for the neighbors in the area and that we are part of finding a solution.   So, I think it' s something that we need to work together,  City,  the school,  and the neighbors on finding a solution that works for everybody.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner Menendez.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Thank you, Mayor.   Speaking of Salvadore Park,  I drove by the other evening,  and I noticed a great many cars parked,  I guess,  next to the dog park.
