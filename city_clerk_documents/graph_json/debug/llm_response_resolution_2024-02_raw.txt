Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the given resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by reading through the document text carefully. The document is titled "RESOLUTION NO. 2024-02" and it's about confirming the appointment of John "Miles" Maronto to the Transportation Advisory Board. The main sections are sections 1, 2, and 3, which outline the confirmation, term, and effective date of the resolution.

Looking at the end of the document, after the passage date and the names of the Mayor, City Clerk, and City Attorney, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: D-2)". The phrase "AgendaItem" is followed by "D-2" in parentheses. That seems like the agenda item code they're asking for. 

I need to make sure there aren't any other mentions elsewhere. Let me scan the document again. The beginning mentions the resolution number and the subject but no agenda item there. The sections of the resolution don't mention it either. The only place it appears is towards the end, right before the attestation and signatures. 

The code format is a letter followed by a hyphen and a number. "D-2" fits that pattern. The example given in the instructions includes things like E-2 or F-10, so D-2 matches that structure. 

I should check if there's any possibility of another code being present. The document has "DocuSign Envelope ID" at the very end, but that's a long alphanumeric string and not an agenda item. 

Since the user emphasized to return ONLY the code and nothing else, and the example shows "AGENDA_ITEM: D-2", I need to make sure that's exactly what I provide. No extra text or explanations. 

Therefore, the correct code here is D-2. No other codes are present, so NOT_FOUND isn't applicable here.

AGENDA_ITEM: D-2
