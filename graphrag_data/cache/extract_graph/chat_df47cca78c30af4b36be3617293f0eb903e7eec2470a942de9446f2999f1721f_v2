Gables, identify all entities and their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Thank you, I appreciate it.   It' s good to know.  Sometimes it' s important to have visuals.   You did very good, you can do Wheel of Fortune one day.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   It's excellent,  great idea.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Vanna White.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, Belkys.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I spoke to a few folks in the commercial real estate industry.   That was a pretty good line.   And they made a comment,  a thought that,  and it probably holds true.   First off, what department in the City is tasked with making sure signage is the right size?  Do we have a --?\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSuÆrez:  Code --  that would be Code Enforcement,  sir.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   It would be Code Enforcement.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   It would be a Code Enforcement violation to violate our sign ordinance.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Because one thought was that it's possible that folks are putting signs actually bigger than what is allowed.   And if that' s the case,  we may first want to make sure -have Code Enforcement spend a couple of months trying to see how many businesses are using signage above and beyond what' s already allowed.   Because what I'm hearing is the folks in the industry want to keep it as is.  They' re not saying let' s go bigger.   But if some are going bigger, they' re tainting the businesses or the reputation of what' s happening by those that are abiding by the law.  So, my preference would be to see --  have Code Enforcement see what they can find out in terms of are folks actually going above and beyond what' s allowed.  If that' s the case, why don' t we crack down on those individuals and then come back and see if that perhaps helped the situation that,  you know, perhaps is out there.   That' s my take.   Thank you.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' ll be happy to have Code Enforcement look at it, and they do enforce it when it's --  basically,  the residential is 4 by 10…\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   And the commercial is 16 by 16 inches or just a hair below that.  And they should be enforcing that,  but we' ll make an issue and we' ll…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   The fact that it's now a discussion publicly,  you know, we all -- Code Enforcement,  we all handle a million things.  And sometimes it' s --  you know, we shine a light on an issue.   Let' s focus on that issue and see what we come up with.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner,  do you have any comments?\n\nCommissioner Castro: Yes,  I wouldn' t be opposed to giving them a little more time for some community input on your Real Estate Committee as well.  And then I guess we could take it from there.\n\nMayor Lago:   So, I just want to talk a few points on this ordinance.   First, I'd like to have Belkys come up for a second so we can kind of compare when we talk about the wrap ordinance.   I know I didn' t ask you to do this before,  I just kind of found out about this ordinance on Friday,  so we really didn' t have much time to really go over it, and I thought about it over the weekend.   I didn' t want to bother you over the weekend. So,  when we talked about the wrap ordinance that I sponsored in 2022,  how long did we work on that,  how much input did we garner from the community?   Because we transformed wraps,  the wraps that we…\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Right, yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   Put on the businesses now.  How did we do that?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   It was a process.\n\nMayor Lago:   To the best that you remember.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I would say probably two to three months that we worked on it and we refined it.   We looked at other communities to see what they were doing.   We talked I personally talked to the City of Miami Beach.\n\nMayor Lago:   We met with Mark Trowbridge.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Obviously,  we involved the Chamber as well.\n\nMayor Lago:   The BID back then.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Yes,  and the BID, because it was --  it was an iteration that we took of the Business Improvement District.   They had a wrap, but we basically wanted to do it citywide also.   So,  it wasn' t just,  you know, the Central Business District or the BID area. So, yeah,  it took a bit.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  and I remember that I also,  if I remember correctly,  and the Clerk can make a public records request,  we also put it as a discussion item to get input from the Commission before we even embarked on the ordinance process to see if there was buy-in.  I try to do that as much as I possibly can just to make sure that if anybody has any input, they can, you know, provide that input and they can --  we can move forward on a process that has some sort of legs before we move further.   I'll give you an example.
