It benefits from an educational exemption but lacks dedicated parking facilities, which has led to ongoing parking and neighborhood maintenance issues. To accommodate its needs, the school has been expanding by purchasing adjacent single-family homes, increasing its footprint beyond the original square footage. This expansion has raised concerns among neighbors, including the Toyos family, who have noted potential violations of existing covenants related to property use.\n\nDespite these challenges, the school has not proposed increasing its student enrollment beyond the current limit and remains subject to prior approvals, site plan restrictions, and enrollment caps. The school is located near Salvadore Park and has been actively engaged in addressing neighborhood concerns, particularly regarding parking. It regularly communicates parking rules to parents through monthly newsletters and takes measures to prevent parking on swales to minimize disruption.\n\nOverall, the SCHOOL is navigating a complex situation involving growth and neighborhood relations, with ongoing efforts to resolve conflicts related to parking, property use, and community impact.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762931, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 498, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
