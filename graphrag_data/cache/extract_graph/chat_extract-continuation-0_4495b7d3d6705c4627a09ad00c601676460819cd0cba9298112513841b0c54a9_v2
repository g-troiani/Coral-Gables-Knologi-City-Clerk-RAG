strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

I've even had it on the garage,  and they' ve complied through Code Enforcement.  How did we get it done before?\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Ceballos:  So, I personally have never had to deal with that particular issue before. What I can do is I can find out from Code Enforcement how they' ve handled it in the past.  I can let you know. I can look into it for you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Isn' t it also a fire code issue?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Just to give - that' s one of my major concerns and the reason that I'm putting this in here.  I know that it is a major fire issue.  I've driven through parts of North Gables where you have homes that have shutters on every single opening that' s visible from the street.  I also think we are trying to keep a look for our city, we go through this lengthy approval process to make sure that homes look good and look appropriate for Code Enforcement,  and this is one thing. I understand during hurricane season sometimes you have that first storm that comes up, you put up your shutters,  and it is cumbersome and difficult to remove them.  We have folks who don' t necessarily have the ability to do it themselves and have to rely on family members.  So,  what I wanted to do was give a buffer so that you have through the end of hurricane season and possibly a storm that lingers after hurricane season and give a two-week cushion after that last storm or after the end of hurricane season for folks to take them down.  I think after hurricane seasons complete those shutters should be taken down for the reasons that have been addressed.\n\nMayor Lago:  Any public comment,  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have a question.  I don' t see a warning procedure in here. Most things that we deal with, and this is not a life - we usually have a warning procedure.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, this isn' t sending a specific enforcement mechanism in this ordinance. It would revert to our standard,  which is we can always issue a warning.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Some of these -  I can understand why there' s not a warning on some of the items here listed, but I would like a warning.  Homeowners Association always tells somebody you have 30-35 days to take them down otherwise XYZ penalty will be imposed.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm willing to bet that when you think about it, the person who probably has their shutters up for a long time is an elderly person.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  Who paid somebody to put their shutters up or a daughter or son to go and put their shutters up,  they don' t live in Miami- Dade County or they do, but they are busy with their own\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nlives and they haven' t been able to get to it, because its an endeavor and you are talking about somebody you hit them with another $ 500 fine right off the bat, its tough, you know, and then we get the call and its like, you know how it works, its like we send it to you and show leniency,  this person is 90 years old, what do we do.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Miami Lakes had the same sort of thing, and I was the shutter- installer,  so I had to make time.\n\nMayor Lago:  Or the person is disabled,  good example.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not an easy process.  I've done it and it's not fun.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No, no, its not fun, that' s why I think at least 30 days.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.  I thought there was a provision that we would fall back on, that was my understanding.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, a Code Enforcement Officer always has the ability to issue a warning before enforcement. If the Commission wants to mandate in this particular regulation that a warning must be issued first, we can certainly incorporate that into it.\n\nMayor Lago:  If the sponsor would allow me. I would want to make sure that that' s memorialized because at the end of the day,  I'm pretty sure we' re dealing with elderly people,  older people, disabled people who, I don' t think anybody wants to live in their house completely shuddered like that, you don' t see any sunlight.  I don' t think it' s a very pleasant situation.  So, I think those people probably need to be pushed or helped in one way or another to get those shutters off.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'd be happy to amend it to add a 30-day warning as the first course of action from the city.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Mr. Clerk, do we\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>MEETING<|>A meeting of the City Commission of Coral Gables during which discussion about building code, fire code, and shutter removal enforcement took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Iglesias<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Iglesias, who raised concerns about building code issues related to ventilation and egress in unsafe structures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, who led the discussion, asked questions about enforcement of shutter removal and expressed concern for elderly and disabled residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, who questioned the presence of a warning procedure and advocated for a 30-day warning period before enforcement penalties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, who expressed concerns about fire safety and aesthetics related to shutters, proposed a buffer period after hurricane season for shutter removal, and supported adding a 30-day warning before enforcement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Attorney Ceballos<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Ceballos, who stated he has not dealt with the shutter issue before but will investigate past Code Enforcement actions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Suarez, who explained that the ordinance does not specify enforcement mechanisms but that standard procedures allow warnings before enforcement, and offered to incorporate a mandatory warning into the regulation if desired by the Commission.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Clerk Urquia<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Urquia, who reported no public comments during the meeting.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Iglesias<|>City Manager Iglesias participated in the City Commission Meeting discussing building code issues.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Mayor Lago<|>Mayor Lago led and participated in the City Commission Meeting discussing shutter removal and enforcement.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Vice Mayor Anderson participated in the City Commission Meeting, questioning warning procedures and advocating for a 30-day warning.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Commissioner Fernandez participated in the City Commission Meeting, expressing fire safety concerns and proposing a buffer and warning period.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>City Attorney Ceballos<|>City Attorney Ceballos participated in the City Commission Meeting, offering to research past Code Enforcement handling.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>City Attorney Suarez participated in the City Commission Meeting, explaining enforcement procedures and offering to amend the ordinance.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>City Clerk Urquia<|>City Clerk Urquia participated in the City Commission Meeting and reported no public comments.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Mayor Lago responded to Vice Mayor Anderson's questions and comments about warning procedures and elderly residents.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Mayor Lago and Commissioner Fernandez discussed the need for a buffer period and warning for shutter removal.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Vice Mayor Anderson and Commissioner Fernandez agreed on the importance of a 30-day warning before enforcement.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>Vice Mayor Anderson questioned enforcement procedures, to which City Attorney Suarez responded about warnings.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>Commissioner Fernandez and City Attorney Suarez discussed incorporating a mandatory warning into the ordinance.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
