They had a wrap, but we basically wanted to do it citywide also.   So,  it wasn' t just,  you know, the Central Business District or the BID area. So, yeah,  it took a bit.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  and I remember that I also,  if I remember correctly,  and the Clerk can make a public records request,  we also put it as a discussion item to get input from the Commission before we even embarked on the ordinance process to see if there was buy-in.  I try to do that as much as I possibly can just to make sure that if anybody has any input, they can, you know, provide that input and they can --  we can move forward on a process that has some sort of legs before we move further.   I'll give you an example.   So, the faux grass in the front of homes that we see now in driveways.   That was something that I put as a discussion item,  I think probably one or two times.  We brought it on first reading,  and then obviously,  Commissioner Fernandez requested that it go to the BOA.  The BOA was resoundingly in support of it, it came back, and it failed with the Commission.   That' s what I would recommend.   I would recommend that,  in my opinion,  is that you get some input from the Chamber,  at a minimum,  the Chamber.   They are the heart and pulse of the business community here.   We have a great Chamber.   Again,  Mark and the Chair to really give some input,  to sit down,  and as a licensed realtor,  I can tell you who has purchased a good amount of commercial real estate,  some of my best finds, some of my best finds have been walking by a property.   And one of the things that we' re not discussing today,  and I can give you examples of that, where both in the City of Coral Gables and outside the City, I've been walking or driving by, and I have found a piece of property where, you know, there was a sign, I hadn' t even engaged LoopNet,  or I hadn' t even engaged the MLS.   That' s number one.   Number two, a lot of people don' t even have MLS.   They don' t.  They don' t want to pay the fee,  it's not a requirement,  and they don' t have LoopNet yet. Another issue that I'm seeing is obviously the DBPR.   This is something that I was researching very quickly.   We, as a Commission,  got multiple emails from realtors and calls in opposition of this.  I didn' t have one person that told me that this was a good idea,  but I'm always willing to look at the other side of the coin if it makes sense.   But one of the things that they brought to my attention was listen,  Vince,  the DBPR has certain language that' s required,  that' s required to be exhibited on the for sale or for lease or for rent signage.   It makes it incredibly difficult to fit all that language on such a small,  you know, little piece of document that is exhibited for sale or for lease.  Another issue that we haven' t discussed,  but I think it's something that you should consider when you' re talking with all these leaders of industry.   I talked to the head of the Real Estate --  South Florida Real Estate Association,  which is located here in Coral Gables,  adjacent to the fire station.   I know that they' re in opposition of this issue.  Was something that I just thought about right now.  What about for sale by owner?  I bought one property for sale by owner from a lady who, in the building that I was living in, I happened to just walk by and she had this sign in the apartment building,  when I used to live in 100 Edgewater,  over a decade ago. So, I happened to walk by, she was selling it for sale by owner,  I negotiated with her, and I ended up buying the property.   How are we going to address for sale by owner signage,  which I think is something that needs to be considered,  because when you go to, let' s say, Home Depot,  or you go to OfficeMax,  I haven' t been there in a while, but they sell for sale by owner signs.   You can order\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nthem online.   You just have to put your information on it, and how will we address that?   So,  to me,  I think that what I would recommend is that you go back and we speak with multiple community leaders to find a way to bridge the gap and to better understand what are the benefits of this ordinance?   What are we going to get out of it?   Because when we talk about sign pollution, and I'm a huge proponent of it, I've driven with Code Enforcement probably four or five times to try to remove as many signs as possible throughout the City on the trolleys.  I think there' s always an opportunity to reduce sign pollution.   And we have a resident who, I'm not sure if he copies everyone here,  but he probably does,  who sends us probably on a weekly basis signs that are throughout the City that are, you know\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_71e7bac4e76dda438948baf6f42bac63107f1dae69cb052f5e9cbdd3fad118b2_v2"}
