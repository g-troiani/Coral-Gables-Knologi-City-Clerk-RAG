The board convenes at a time and place designated by the city clerk, beginning after 7:00 a.m. on election day, to publicly canvass absentee ballots. During its proceedings, the board selects a chairperson to lead the process and establishes criteria for determining the validity of absentee ballots, guided by recommendations from the city attorney and a representative from the county supervisor of elections. Ballots deemed invalid are marked as \"REJECTED AS ILLEGAL,\" while valid ballots are separated for counting. After 7:00 p.m. on election day, the board counts the absentee votes, signs a certificate documenting the number of valid and invalid ballots, and promptly certifies the election results. In the event a recount is necessary, the board completes certification within two days following the election.
