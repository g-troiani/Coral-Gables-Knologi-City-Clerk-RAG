Mr. Clerk,  moving on to Item E-8.  Commissioner Fernandez,  this is your item.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  Mayor,  E-8 is an ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107,  real estate for sale, lease, or rental of property or buildings to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease,  or rental of property or buildings in any use district;  providing for severability clause,  repealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date.  This is a public hearing item.  I've asked the Deputy City Attorney to please explain what the proposed ordinance sets forth.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: So,  just a little on the --  on the background on why I put this on the agenda.   It came from a resident who had asked me, why is there a difference between the size of signs that are allowed in residential neighborhoods versus in commercial?   And started looking into it and started driving around downtown Coral Gables and I did see how some of these signs are pretty large and you have windows that just --  just have the sign up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Oh, you need to rewind it right now.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yeah,  start all over?  So…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Take it back.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   If we are take --  if we are doing so much to ensure the beautification of our Central Business District and our business area of our city,  we invest so much time in ensuring that we have the right window coverings,  I think it' s important to also reduce the size of some of these signs that are being placed on windows,  some of them for an extended period of time when they are for management companies,  just to ensure that we maintain a uniform look, if we' re talking about uniform look for our lights as well,  uniform look for our signs.   I did have conversations with a few commercial real estate agents before putting this item on the agenda.  The general consensus I got from them --  and I know there are differing opinions because we have received some emails from realtors about this item -- but the general consensus was that they have not seen a lot of clients lately that have just been driving around the city or walking around looking for property.   Most commercial clients have a realtor that they' re familiar with or that they use, and they work with them to find the property.  So, the larger signs are not necessarily as important.\n\nAssistant City Attorney\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c3afc426d4fe6760c576f6d8fb879e9685bec707d86d1d4d33c3c389849d5f1e_v2"}
