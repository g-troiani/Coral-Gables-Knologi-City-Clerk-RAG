Specifically, it allows developments to reach the highest height permitted within a one-mile radius of the development site, overriding the standard height caps of 70 feet for MX2 and 150 feet for MX3 districts. This legislative change potentially enables taller buildings than previously allowed, which could have significant implications for urban density, skyline, and community character.
