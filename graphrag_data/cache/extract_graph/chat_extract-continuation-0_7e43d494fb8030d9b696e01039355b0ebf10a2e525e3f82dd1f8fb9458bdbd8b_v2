rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nEntity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION\nText: \"Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed. This is Ordinance 2024-01.\"\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, which is the same as Ordinance 2024-01 and amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, also known as agenda item E-1, which amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same as<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Real Data-\nEntity types: agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project\nText: | Mail |                                                                 | 13 days                                                                | 13 days                                                                |                                                                        |\n| Development Agreement 7                                                             | Development Agreement 7                                                | Development Agreement 7                                                | Development Agreement 7                                                | Development Agreement 7                                                |\n| General 7                                                                           | Pub lica tion                                                          | 7 days                                                                 | 7 days                                                                 | 7 days                                                                 |\n|                                                                                     | ron                                                                    | 10 days                                                                |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| Affected Property Owners                                                            | Mail |                                                                 | 13 days                                                                |                                                                        | 13 days                                                                |\n| Historic Preservation: Designations and Certificate of Appropriateness              | Historic Preservation: Designations and Certificate of Appropriateness | Historic Preservation: Designations and Certificate of Appropriateness | Historic Preservation: Designations and Certificate of Appropriateness | Historic Preservation: Designations and Certificate of Appropriateness |\n| Designation of Landmark or District                                                 | puplica                                                                | 10 days                                                                |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n|                                                                                     | re                                                                     | 10 days                                                                |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n|                                                                                     | Mail |                                                                 | 13 days                                                                | 7 :                                                                    |                                                                        |\n| Certificate of Appropriateness ( Special)                                           | Pu a                                                                   | 10 days                                                                |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n\n| Type of Application (                                   | Type of pe Notice (                          | Board Publ -. ic Hearing : if required) . .   | os .
