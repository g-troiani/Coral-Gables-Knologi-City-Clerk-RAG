relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Thank you for being here with us.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Good morning,  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  Commissioners,  Mr. Manager,  Mr. Clerk and Ms. Attorney.  I'd like to speak to you today about the issue of streetlights.  I know I have spoken with most of you regarding this issue,  but I'd like to bring up a little something here just to share with you to continue that conversation.  I'll also be back to you later this morning for a resolution, an item by the Historic Preservation Board.  I've put together just a simple citizens presentation here for you, just to go through for a few minutes.  Regarding the streetlights -  streetlights as all of\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nus know are more than just lighting.  It's urban design.  It's decoration.  Its branding.  It' s what our community is. And so, Coral Gables began installing streetlights in the early 1920s as part of its master suburb and the streetlighting was always unique to Miami-Dade County.  Mr. Clerk.\n\n## City Clerk Urquia:  Yes sir.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Mr. Maxwell:  Thank you. There' s a 1923 photo of the Country Club all of us go to and enjoy and this is outside of Le Parc right now, and you can see that those are two streetlights that are not only representative of what we had,  but they were the majority lights throughout the community as Merrick developed it and into the 20s, and even after the city sold the lighting system to FPL in 1926.  You can see here in the commercial district,  there' s a representative streetlight.  All of the streetlights that were put in were called White Way Lights at that time. So,  streetlight was not a term that was generally used.  It was called a White Way Light. And it didn' t matter what kind of light it was. It was a White Way Light because we had white ways. Most of the streets were dark ways. Next please. Thank you. There' s an advertisement in the January 4, 1923, Miami Metropolis, and you can see in the picture there,  Dammers and Gillette,  are advertising the beautiful streets of this city. And what kind of streetlights do they show? - they show the standard city silver streetlight that we have today.  Next please.  At the time that the city was developed and really into the 30s, these were the three standard streetlights that the city seemed to have.  I'm sure that there were others mounted on a wood pole or something,  but this is what we can see mostly in pictures and in correspondence. You can see the Fink light, which surrounds the Douglas Entrance,  and those lights were used at some of the most important places in the city. They weren' t on Coral Way, they weren' t at DeSoto Fountain,  but they were at places like the Douglas Entrance.  You can see the standard metal and then you can also see what I call this transit line fixture. You know, we had a wonderful trolley that went through here, and those lights are attached to the electric lines that the trolley went to. The fountains and all of the monuments and entrances that we have all had the same type of what we call luminaire.  So, you can see that the fixtures in there all match what was there. Everything was silver. Everything had a look so that when you came into Coral Gables you knew that you were in a special place.  Thank you. You can see the transit light after the war over here on Miracle Mile, and then how that Fink light is there at the Douglas Entrance.  The history of the lights is really interesting.  In the 1980s,  right now I had the opportunity to go through the city archives and dig out a bunch of things,  because you know,  we' ve been working on this for ever and ever and ever,  and in 1980,  the city and the Historic Preservation Board identified 21 different types of streetlights in our city. I'm going to show you in just a few minutes almost a dozen.  The City Commission received a report and then discussed,  and I can' t find an action item where they actually adopted it but sought to standardize the streetlights in 1980 and begin working diligently with not only the Historic Preservation Board,  and the Board of Architects and other advisors,  but with the Florida Power and Light Company and Public Works Department.  After a while, about a year, it was an Arcadian fixture, which you can see right here, was selected and it's actually in the catalog of this company and it's called a Coral Gables Light Fixture, and this is the one that' s been\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_64ad270459c23b486549b9e9968a4c41ee2d2562351034c50e44ccd5f0dd7c04_v2"}
