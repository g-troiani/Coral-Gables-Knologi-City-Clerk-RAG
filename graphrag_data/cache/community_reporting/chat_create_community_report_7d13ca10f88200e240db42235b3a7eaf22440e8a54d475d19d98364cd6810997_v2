It conducts public hearings and approves or disapproves applications for dredging, filling, construction of bulkheads, seawalls, docks, and mooring piles, often requiring biological and ecological studies and coordination with agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and trustees of the internal improvement fund. The Commission also manages city-owned property sales or leases and sets policies related to these assets.\n\nThe Commission is responsible for adopting resolutions and ordinances concerning the city’s sewage disposal system, including fixing and revising rates, fees, and charges, compelling treatment of sewage by industrial plants, and authorizing sewer revenue bonds.

city authorities, including the Planning and Zoning Board, City Commission, and Historic Preservation Board, to review and consider applications, proposals, and matters related to city planning, zoning, construction, and public services. These hearings serve as formal opportunities for public input and transparency in municipal decision-making processes.\n\nWhen conducted by the Planning and Zoning Board, a public hearing involves reviewing the entire record of an application in accordance with the zoning code and specific sections (62-328 and 62-330). This review is often part of the site plan review and approval process, ensuring compliance with local regulations.\n\nThe City Commission holds public hearings to authorize the construction, modification, or operation of enumerated city facilities. Such hearings require public notice, typically published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the meeting. Additionally, courtesy notices may be mailed to nearby property owners, and signs may be posted on the affected property to inform the community.\n\nPublic hearings by the City Commission also address ordinances, zoning amendments, and other city matters, with public notice provided through publication and/or mail to ensure community awareness and participation. Specific hearings include those for dredging and filling work, which follow an investigation and recommendation by the director of the public works department. These require at least 15 days' published notice and courtesy mailings to riparian property owners within 1,000 feet of the proposed work, allowing affected parties to voice support or concerns before the permit is approved or denied.\n\nIn matters related to public utilities, a public hearing is mandated before fixing rates, fees, or charges for the sewage disposal system. This hearing allows all users and interested parties to be heard regarding proposed changes, ensuring fair and transparent rate-setting.\n\nAdditionally, under Section 166.0451 of the Florida Statutes, the governing body of the municipality must hold a public hearing to review the inventory list of city-owned real property deemed appropriate for affordable housing, facilitating community involvement in housing policy decisions.\n\nThe Historic Preservation Board and City Commission also conduct public hearings to consider requests such as Special Certificates of Appropriateness or Government Settlement reviews. These hearings require advance publication and posting of notices to inform the public and solicit input.\n\nOverall, PUBLIC HEARINGS are essential components of municipal governance, providing structured forums for public participation, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making across a wide range of city functions and projects.\",10\n259,RIPARIAN PROPERTY OWNERS,\"Riparian property owners are individuals or entities who own property adjacent to or near a water body, specifically within 1,000 feet of proposed dredging and filling work. These owners are identified based on the latest city tax rolls and are notified through courtesy notices. The notifications inform them about the proposed dredging and filling activities as well as upcoming public hearings related to permit applications for such work. This process ensures that riparian property owners are kept informed and have the opportunity to participate in discussions or raise concerns regarding the impact of the proposed activities on their properties and the surrounding environment.\",3\n251,U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS,\"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a federal agency responsible for approving permits related to various construction and environmental activities. Their approval is required after the City Commission grants initial approval for applications involving dredging and filling work. Additionally, the agency oversees and approves permit extensions for these activities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also plays a crucial role in the approval process for permits concerning the construction of bulkheads, seawalls, and other shore-related projects.
