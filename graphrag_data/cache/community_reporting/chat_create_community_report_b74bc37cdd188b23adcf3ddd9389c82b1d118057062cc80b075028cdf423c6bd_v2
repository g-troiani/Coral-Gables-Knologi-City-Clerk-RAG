Following the approval of a Zoning in Progress Resolution, City staff report to the Board, which plays a key role in reviewing and advising on zoning and land use issues. The Board holds public hearings on a variety of planning matters, including Comprehensive Plan updates, Zoning Code text amendments, and Zoning District map amendments involving areas larger than 10 acres.\n\nThe Board is actively involved in the site plan review and approval process, considering requests and reviewing the entire record after duly advertised public hearings in accordance with the zoning code and relevant municipal sections (62-328 and 62-330). It provides recommendations to the City Commission based on these reviews and the input received during hearings. The Board also reviews major amendments to site plans and changes in land use or zoning, ensuring that developments comply with city regulations and community standards.\n\nIn addition to its regulatory functions, the Planning and Zoning Board addresses local planning concerns such as parking and neighborhood infrastructure. For example, it has requested the expansion of swale improvements along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia to mitigate parking and related issues. The Board has also sought cooperation from clients and stakeholders to develop swale packages, reflecting its involvement in public safety and neighborhood quality of life matters. At times, the Board has directed responsibility for certain issues to other parties, emphasizing collaborative problem-solving.\n\nThe Board’s recommendations often include specific conditions to balance development goals with community interests. For instance, in reviewing a school project, the Board recommended approval with three conditions: windows facing the east neighbor must remain fixed and inoperative, limitations on the number of children must be maintained, and heavy landscaping should be installed at the front of the building. Similarly, for a major amendment approved in November, the Board imposed conditions including non-operable fixed windows facing neighboring properties and required swale improvements.\n\nThroughout its activities, the Planning and Zoning Board serves as a critical intermediary between City staff, developers, residents, and the City Commission, ensuring that zoning and planning decisions are made transparently and with due consideration of all relevant factors. It plays a vital role in shaping the City’s development patterns, maintaining neighborhood character, and addressing infrastructure and environmental concerns related to land use and zoning.\",28\n703,RESIDENTIAL_PARKING_PERMIT,\"Residential parking permit program in Coral Gables, featuring green poles and extruded signs designed to blend with the community and reduce sign pollution, discussed as a solution for parking issues near Salvadore dog park.\",4\n147,SECTION 62-330,A section of the city code referenced as part of the procedures the Planning and Zoning Board follows when reviewing the entire record after a public hearing.,1\n544,NEIGHBOR AT PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD,A neighbor who appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and contributed to the addition of a condition requiring the church to landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia.,1\n570,NON-OPERABLE FIXED WINDOWS CONDITION,Condition of approval requiring non-operable fixed windows on the façade facing the adjacent abutting neighbor to the east as part of the major amendment approval.,1\n635,SWALE IMPROVEMENT,,1\n543,STAFF,\"The staff of the City of Coral Gables play a multifaceted role in supporting the community and municipal operations.
