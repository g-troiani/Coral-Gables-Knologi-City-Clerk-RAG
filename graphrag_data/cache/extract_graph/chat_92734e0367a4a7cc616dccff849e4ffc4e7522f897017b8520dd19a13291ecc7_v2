rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

Mr. Clerk,  moving on to Item E-8.  Commissioner Fernandez,  this is your item.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  Mayor,  E-8 is an ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107,  real estate for sale, lease, or rental of property or buildings to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease,  or rental of property or buildings in any use district;  providing for severability clause,  repealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date.  This is a public hearing item.  I've asked the Deputy City Attorney to please explain what the proposed ordinance sets forth.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: So,  just a little on the --  on the background on why I put this on the agenda.   It came from a resident who had asked me, why is there a difference between the size of signs that are allowed in residential neighborhoods versus in commercial?   And started looking into it and started driving around downtown Coral Gables and I did see how some of these signs are pretty large and you have windows that just --  just have the sign up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Oh, you need to rewind it right now.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yeah,  start all over?  So…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Take it back.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   If we are take --  if we are doing so much to ensure the beautification of our Central Business District and our business area of our city,  we invest so much time in ensuring that we have the right window coverings,  I think it' s important to also reduce the size of some of these signs that are being placed on windows,  some of them for an extended period of time when they are for management companies,  just to ensure that we maintain a uniform look, if we' re talking about uniform look for our lights as well,  uniform look for our signs.   I did have conversations with a few commercial real estate agents before putting this item on the agenda.  The general consensus I got from them --  and I know there are differing opinions because we have received some emails from realtors about this item -- but the general consensus was that they have not seen a lot of clients lately that have just been driving around the city or walking around looking for property.   Most commercial clients have a realtor that they' re familiar with or that they use, and they work with them to find the property.  So, the larger signs are not necessarily as important.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Throckmorton: Thank you,  Commissioner. So,  just to give a brief overview,  as you mentioned,  just to give us the specifics here,  actually,  currently signs in SFR, MF1,  MF2, MF3, and MF4 districts shall not be larger than 40 square inches with an additional\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nbottom sign with certain language.   And then signs in MX1, MX2, MX3 districts shall be no larger than 250 square inches.   So, this would change the requirement for those MX1, MX2, and MX3 districts from 250 inches down to the 40 square inches that is permitted in those more residential neighborhoods that we discussed.\n\nMayor Lago:   Would you like to hear public comment or would you like…\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   For the Commission first?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Let' s go ahead and do public comment.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   First speaker\n\nis Sarah Hernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Chair, good to see you.\n\nSarah Hernandez: Thank you. Mr.  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  the Commissioners, thank you for allowing me to stay here today and give you the opinion of the business community as through the lens of the Chamber\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_92734e0367a4a7cc616dccff849e4ffc4e7522f897017b8520dd19a13291ecc7_v2"}
