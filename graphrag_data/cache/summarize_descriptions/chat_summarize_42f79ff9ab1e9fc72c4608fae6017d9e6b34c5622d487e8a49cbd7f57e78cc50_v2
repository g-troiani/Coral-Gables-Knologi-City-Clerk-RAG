It collaborates closely with the City of Coral Gables, the Historic Preservation Board, and other entities to ensure cohesive urban development, including efforts to standardize streetlight fixtures throughout the city. The Board plays a significant role in the review and approval process for development projects, including those influenced by local regulations such as the Live Local Act.\n\nA notable example of the Board’s work is its involvement in the design and approval of the new preschool building for St. Philip's School. The Board conducted multiple reviews of the proposed building design, including consultations with the Design Review Committee (DRC) and neighborhood meetings, before granting approval in April and again in August. During this process, the Board required specific architectural modifications to enhance the building’s aesthetic appeal and maintain the community’s character. One key requirement was the inclusion of windows on the eastern side of the building, a change that overrode a previous condition from the 2001-2003 master plan, which had prohibited windows on that side. The Board insisted on a combination of fixed and operable windows to avoid an institutional appearance and to improve the building’s overall design quality.\n\nThrough its advisory and regulatory functions, the Board of Architects ensures that new developments in Coral Gables align with established architectural standards and community expectations, balancing historical preservation with contemporary needs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749842380, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 290, "prompt_tokens": 444, "total_tokens": 734, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
