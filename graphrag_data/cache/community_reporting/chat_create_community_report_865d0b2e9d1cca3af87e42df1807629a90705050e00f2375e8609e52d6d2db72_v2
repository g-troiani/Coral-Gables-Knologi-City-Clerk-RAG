The key entities include the City Manager, property owners, various formal notices issued to property owners, and law enforcement officers who serve these notices when standard delivery methods fail.

This authority includes certifying expenses to the finance director and enforcing payment through special assessment liens with interest and penalties. The City Manager's role ensures that the city maintains updated infrastructure by compelling compliance or initiating conversion at the property owner's expense.

The 'NOTICE OF PROPERTY OWNER'S FAILURE TO CONVERT FACILITIES' is a critical document issued by the City Manager to property owners who have not completed the required underground conversion. This notice demands completion within 60 days and warns of city-initiated conversion and lien imposition if ignored. Additionally, the 'NOTICE REQUIRING CONVERSION OF UTILITY SERVICE FACILITIES' serves as the form used for these notices, specifying a 30-day compliance window after personal service or second publication.

When registered mail service fails or personal service is not possible, officers serve the notices by physically posting them on the property or delivering them to occupants or agents. This ensures that the city meets legal requirements for notification, which is vital for the legitimacy of subsequent enforcement actions such as conversion and lien imposition.
