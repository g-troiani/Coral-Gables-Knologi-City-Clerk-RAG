RESOLUTION: BOTH filing numbers (2024-123) AND permanent numbers\n4. PERSON: Officials, citizens, staff\n5. ORGANIZATION: Departments, companies, agencies\n6.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

So, you can see all the trees are basically ready there for the contractor to take them to plant them somewhere in the neighborhoods.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Right. And in our Public Works yard we have about 40 oaks. We' re trying to green them up with more water before we plant them.  They dropped all their leaves,  and they are a little brown for our taste, so we' re waiting for them to green up.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  I used to do that by sinking them in six inches of water or more,  because they can tolerate about six weeks'  worth of being in standing water,  any of the ones that went into shock and then I would see the growth,  but right now they are dropping their leaves anyway.  So, a lot of yellowing there.  Where we have the most heat,  generally, is in our Central Business District.  I've seen some plantings that when they were put in, depending on where the location is, the ones that are more isolated with more asphalt around them and reflection are the ones of course that suffer the most and then some of the others of the same variety of tree have no problem making it. So, its planting,  location,  and conditions,  and soils,  and all those things that go into whether or not they will survive.  So, I did see live oaks out in El Paso when I was there, so I don' t know if its really necessarily the heat level or the lack of a freeze,  I guess some research that someone would\n\nhave to do on whether or not they need a freeze,  but I know that that' s true with many other varieties of trees and why we can' t grow Sycamores down here and so forth.  It's not because it doesn' t get hot elsewhere.  It was 102 degrees in Chicago one year.  It's not the heat so much,  its does that tree require a freeze and where is it planted.  So, it was a brutal summer.  My kids wanted to go shopping.  Is it air-conditioned was the only question I kept asking them.  So,  yes,  looking forward to the trees getting planted.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  So, what I would like to see done is just have a conversation with Dr. Feely and report back to us on what recommendations he would have.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn: Absolutely. I'm familiar with Dr.  Feely' s research. Our arborist,  our senior arborist and I have looked into it. We' ve read his articles.\n\nMayor Lago:  You' ve already incorporated some of his guidance,  right.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Yes. So basically,  just in a nutshell,  I don' t want to take too much time, but this concern is due to climate change.  Any tropical tree species migrating up to different areas and as we have a heat change in temperature,  he was concerned live oaks might migrate further north,  because they are not a tropical species.  But in our tree succession planning and here' s our list,  and also,  we had zoning code changes this year,  it encourages more tree diversity and we' re following a lot more tree diversity and here' s the list if anyone' s interested, but you can see a big variety of different natives,  flowering trees with a few oaks,  because oaks are still very viable today.  They are the most sustainable tree.  Our senior arborist stands by them. They are so resilient in hurricanes.  You can see the longevity of them in urban areas. Look at Coral Way,  they' ve been here 80-100 years.  Today,  they are still viable and so,  the concept of what' s going to happen in the future because of unknown climate change is good research to be familiar with, there are so many different opinions on it. So that' s where we are.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I appreciate it.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Sure.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Bell-Llewelyn<|>PERSON<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn, responsible for overseeing tree planting and maintenance, knowledgeable about arborist research and tree species viability in the city.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, participant in City Commission Meeting, discussing tree planting conditions and environmental factors affecting tree survival.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, city commissioner requesting follow-up conversation with Dr. Feely regarding tree planting recommendations.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Feely<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Feely, researcher whose work on tree species and climate change is referenced by city officials and arborists.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, city mayor acknowledging incorporation of Dr. Feely's guidance into city tree planning.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting where officials discuss tree planting, climate change impacts, and urban forestry planning.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Public Works Yard<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Public Works yard where about 40 oak trees are currently held and being prepared for planting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Coral Way<|>PROJECT<|>Urban area known for longevity of oak trees, with trees surviving 80-100 years, serving as example of tree resilience.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Tree Succession Planning<|>PROJECT<|>City project focused on planning for tree species succession considering climate change and urban forestry diversity.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zoning Code Changes 2024<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Zoning code changes enacted in 2024 encouraging more tree diversity in the city.)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
