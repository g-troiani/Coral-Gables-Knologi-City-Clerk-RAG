However, this requirement does not apply to the rehabilitation of existing structures when the rehabilitation work amounts to less than 50 percent of the structure's value. In these cases, underground utility installations are not mandatory. Thus, the regulations ensure that new construction and significant upgrades incorporate underground utilities to promote safety and aesthetics, while allowing some flexibility for minor rehabilitation projects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749563693, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
