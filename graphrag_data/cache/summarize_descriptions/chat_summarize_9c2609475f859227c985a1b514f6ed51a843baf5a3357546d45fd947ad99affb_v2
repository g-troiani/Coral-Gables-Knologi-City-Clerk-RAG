This project includes multiple functional and design elements to support early childhood education. At the front of the building are two preschool classrooms, designated as classrooms one and two. Adjacent to the west side of the building, back-of-house equipment will be situated to support operational needs. The front of the site features a restored swale, enhancing drainage and environmental quality, along with a landscaped front yard. To the east, a storage area will serve as a buffer between the preschool and the existing neighboring home, providing separation and privacy. The building also includes a multi-purpose room and a playground located at the rear, offering versatile indoor and outdoor spaces for various activities. Additionally, the façade facing the adjacent neighbor to the east will have fixed, inoperable windows to minimize disturbance and maintain privacy. This comprehensive design has been reviewed and approved by both the Board of Architects and the Planning and Zoning Board, ensuring compliance with relevant standards and community considerations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840845, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
