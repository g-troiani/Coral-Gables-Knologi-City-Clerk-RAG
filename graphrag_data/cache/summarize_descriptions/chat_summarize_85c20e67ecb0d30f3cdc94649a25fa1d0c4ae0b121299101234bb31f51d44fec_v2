This amendment creates Section 5-314 titled \"Window and Hurricane Shutters,\" which regulates the closure of window and hurricane shutters. Additionally, it amends Chapter 1-General Provisions, Section 1-7, entitled \"Penalties,\" to establish penalties for the closure of window and hurricane shutters outside of the designated hurricane season. The ordinance includes a severability clause, a repealer provision, codification, and an effective date.\n\nThe second ordinance, identified as document number 23-6706, concerns the approval of the vacation of a public alleyway pursuant to Zoning Code Article 14, Section 14-211, and City Code Chapter 62, Article 8. This ordinance provides for the vacation of a twenty-foot-wide alley approximately 155 feet in length, located between Lots 12 through 18 and Lots 11 and 19 in Block 29 of the Crafts Section. The affected addresses include 3000 Ponce de Leon Blvd, 216 and 224 Catalonia, 203 University Dr, and 225 Malaga in Coral Gables, Florida. The ordinance includes a repealer provision, severability clause, and an effective date. It was recommended for approval by the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) on December 13, 2023, with a vote of 4-2.

Both ordinances include standard legal provisions such as severability clauses, repealer provisions, and effective dates, and were discussed in recent City Commission meetings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844107, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 423, "prompt_tokens": 893, "total_tokens": 1316, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
