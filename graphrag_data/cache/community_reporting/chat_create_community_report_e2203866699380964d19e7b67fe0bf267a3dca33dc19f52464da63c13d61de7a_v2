Enacted in 2023, it establishes requirements and preemptions of local laws, particularly influencing Section 166.0451 of the Florida Statutes. The Act aims to harmonize local government policies to support affordable housing initiatives statewide, ensuring local regulations align with state mandates. Its influence extends to amendments in Coral Gables’ zoning code, such as Ordinance 23-6828, which incorporates provisions related to parking standards and land use. This central role positions the Live Local Act as the key driver of regulatory changes affecting multiple entities within the community [Data: Entities (155); Relationships (1738, 1734, 1890)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Parking reduction legislation mandated by the Live Local Act\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A significant regulatory outcome of the Live Local Act is the parking reduction legislation, which mandates reduced parking requirements within a half-mile radius of major transit stops. This legislation is designed to encourage public transit use and reduce reliance on private vehicles, thereby supporting sustainable urban development and affordable housing goals. The parking reduction legislation is directly linked to the Live Local Act and applies specifically to areas near designated major transit stops, including metro stations and intersections of bus or trolley routes with frequent service intervals. This relationship underscores the Act’s emphasis on transit-oriented development and its impact on local land use policies [Data: Entities (1136, 155, 1125); Relationships (1738, 1757, 1758, 1759, 1897, 1900)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Definition and role of major transit stops in zoning and parking policies\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Major transit stops are critical entities within this community, defined by the City of Coral Gables as metro stations or intersections where two or more major bus or trolley routes converge with service intervals of 15 minutes or less during peak periods. These stops form the geographic basis for applying parking reduction legislation under the Live Local Act. Specific transit routes and stops, such as the 8th Street bus route and Metrorail stops, are included in the half-mile radius maps used to determine eligibility for parking reductions. This precise definition and mapping of major transit stops enable targeted regulatory measures that promote transit use and influence urban density and parking standards [Data: Entities (1125, 1137, 1138, 1222, 1223); Relationships (1757, 1758, 1759, 1897, 1900)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Floor Area Ratio (FAR) as a key zoning parameter influenced by the Live Local Act\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is a zoning metric that limits the scale of development by controlling building height and density. In Coral Gables, the maximum FAR in mixed-use districts is set at 3.5, a parameter that the Live Local Act preempts in terms of approval processes. This means that the Act influences how FAR is applied and regulated locally, ensuring consistency with state-level affordable housing and development policies.

These districts are visually represented on GIS maps with bluish-gray and greenish colors, respectively, aiding in urban planning and regulatory enforcement. Amendments to signage size regulations, such as those in Agenda Item E-8, affect both districts, reflecting ongoing adjustments to maintain urban character and comply with the Act’s provisions.
