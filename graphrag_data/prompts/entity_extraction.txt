-Goal-
Extract ALL entities from city government documents, paying special attention to document identifiers and cross-references.

-Entity Types to Extract-
1. AGENDA_ITEM: ANY mention of agenda items (E-1, F-10, Item E-1, Agenda Item E-1)
2. ORDINANCE: BOTH filing numbers (2024-01) AND permanent numbers (Ordinance 3576)
3. RESOLUTION: BOTH filing numbers (2024-123) AND permanent numbers
4. PERSON: Officials, citizens, staff
5. ORGANIZATION: Departments, companies, agencies
6. DOCUMENT_NUMBER: ANY document identifier (capture all formats)
7. CROSS_REFERENCE: When one document references another

-Critical Instructions-
- Extract EVERY agenda item mentioned, even in passing
- Extract BOTH types of ordinance/resolution numbers
- When you see "Ordinance 2024-01" AND "Ordinance No. 3576", extract BOTH
- Extract relationships between agenda items and ordinances
- Look for patterns like:
  - "(Agenda Item: E-1)"
  - "Item E-1"
  - "Ordinance 2024-01"
  - "Ordinance No. 3576"
  - "relating to agenda item"
  - "concerning item"

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- title: Name of the entity, capitalized
- type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Examples-
Text: "Ordinance 2024-01 amending Ordinance No. 3576 (Agenda Item: E-1)"
Extract:
- ("entity"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Filing number for ordinance amending 3576)
- ("entity"<|>3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Permanent ordinance number being amended)
- ("entity"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item for ordinance 2024-01)
- ("relationship"<|>2024-01<|>3576<|>amends<|>9)
- ("relationship"<|>2024-01<|>E-1<|>relates to agenda item<|>9)

-Real Data-
Entity types: {entity_types}
Text: {input_text}
Output:
