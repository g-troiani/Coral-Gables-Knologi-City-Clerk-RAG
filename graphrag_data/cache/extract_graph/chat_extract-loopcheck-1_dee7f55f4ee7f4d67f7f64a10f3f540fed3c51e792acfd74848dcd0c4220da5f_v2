By the way,  thank you for being here and reviewing the proposal.  I appreciate that.  I know you' ve got a lot on your plate and that was sent to you late. I thought it was sent to you before.  I would have removed it off the agenda if we weren' t ready for it, my fault. I apologize.  I know you guys rushed it to take a look at that. So, moving onto item F2. You want to just kind of put Pittman Park to rest.  I think we have a graph there,  not a graph, excuse me, a diagram.  We can show Pittman Park, something that I would love one day to be able to embark on,  but I'm just a little bit concerned about whether it' s even viable.  Due to several different things that are kind of in conflict;  number one, the neighboring building,  the alley, trying to close that street and connect the park.  Is there anybody from staff that can show this? Do we have anybody from staff?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  the Public Works Director is - he' s coming up now. I'm sure he' s coming up from the conference room.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. We' ll come back to it.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  He' s right here.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  He' s running up the stairs.\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. Caught you off guard there.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Catch your breath.\n\nMayor Lago:  I gave a preamble that this is not a -  this is a beautiful project,  if we can get it to work, but its not really going to work.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: My apologies.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Its okay. We' re just trying to make sure you get your steps in.\n\nLaughter]\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Yes. Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  Mr. Director,  I was explaining that Pittman,  the idea of bringing Pittman Park into Giralda is a beautiful thing, along with the surface parking lot, but there are many conflicts.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Correct.\n\nMayor Lago: The building, the alley, and it just kind of makes the idea and concept a little difficult.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Public Works Director Diaz: So just a little back story.  The current plan, which is not funded due to cost,  its some improvements to the parking lot behind the Giralda Plaza to match the existing pattern,  right. There are also to be some electrical improvements that will allow that park to on an event put some bollards close off the parking lot. I think it's some upgrade electrical so you could potentially put some, maybe some musical equipment,  that' s the original plan. This plan has been completed;  it's done.  The current estimated -  the last estimate that we have for this, which goes back to March of 2023 was $ 940,000,  so obviously, we haven' t been able to fund this.  So subsequently,  there was a discussion about the potential of joining Pittman Park with the parking lot and obviously there' s, like the Mayor mentioned,  there' s a number of conflicts,  especially you do have an alley,  which we need to make sure that we maintain access to, and the building next door has several entrances and exits that need to be maintained.  So, in a kind of general form, you know, there' s a potential to close the space in between,  as you\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F-2<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item F-2 discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning updates regarding Pittman Park.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>01_09_2024 - Verbatim Transcripts - F-2.pdf<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Document identifier for the verbatim transcript of the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, covering agenda item F-2.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>01.09.2024<|>MEETING<|>Date of the City Commission meeting where agenda item F-2 was discussed.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vince Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor of Coral Gables presiding over the meeting and sponsor of agenda item F-2.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Rhonda Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor of Coral Gables present at the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Melissa Castro<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables present at the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ariel Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables present at the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Kirk Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables present at the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cristina Suárez<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney of Coral Gables present at the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Peter Iglesias<|>PERSON<|>City Manager of Coral Gables present at the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Billy Urquia<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk of Coral Gables present at the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Hermes Diaz<|>PERSON<|>Public Works Director of Coral Gables present at the meeting and providing updates on Pittman Park.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Governing body conducting the meeting on January 9, 2024.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Attorney Office<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department represented by Cristina Suárez.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Manager Office<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department represented by Peter Iglesias.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Clerk Office<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department represented by Billy Urquia.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Public Works Department<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Department represented by Hermes Diaz, responsible for public works and infrastructure.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-2<|>01_09_2024 - Verbatim Transcripts - F-2.pdf<|>The document 01_09_2024 - Verbatim Transcripts - F-2.pdf is the verbatim transcript covering agenda item F-2<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-2<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission<|>Agenda item F-2 was discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vince Lago<|>F-2<|>Mayor Vince Lago sponsored and discussed agenda item F-2<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Hermes Diaz<|>F-2<|>Public Works Director Hermes Diaz provided updates and explanations regarding agenda item F-2<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Peter Iglesias<|>F-2<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias facilitated staff participation during discussion of agenda item F-2<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cristina Suárez<|>City Attorney Office<|>Cristina Suárez represents the City Attorney Office<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Peter Iglesias<|>City Manager Office<|>Peter Iglesias represents the City Manager Office<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Billy Urquia<|>City Clerk Office<|>Billy Urquia represents the City Clerk Office<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Hermes Diaz<|>Public Works Department<|>Hermes Diaz represents the Public Works Department<|>10)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
