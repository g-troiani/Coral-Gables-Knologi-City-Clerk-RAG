This change reflects efforts to achieve cost savings and ensure compliance with Florida Statutes. The ordinance includes provisions ratifying the introductory WHEREAS clauses, repealing any conflicting ordinances, specifying its effective date, and integrating the amendments into the existing Zoning Code. It was passed unanimously with a 5-0 vote, demonstrating full Commission support.\n\nAnother ordinance mandates that when an application is granted by the City Commission, a notice must be published within 30 days in a newspaper of general circulation. Additionally, the ordinance requires recording the notice in the public records and filing a certified copy in the county public records. The financial responsibility for these notices lies with the applicant, ensuring that the city does not bear the associated costs.\n\nFurther, an ordinance discussed by Planning Official Garcia establishes criteria for parking reductions. These criteria include the presence of accessible routes to major transit stops, sidewalks, ramps, and crosswalks.
