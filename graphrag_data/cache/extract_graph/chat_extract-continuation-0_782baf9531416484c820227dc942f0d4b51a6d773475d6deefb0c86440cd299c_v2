I was not exactly thrilled by our decorations on Miracle Mile this year.  I think we can do better.  I know that we did approve a budget for it. I know that there were issues with the timing and with storms and the lighting,  but I would like to see going forward and I did receive some complaints from residents about the decorations on Miracle Mile.  I would like to see this central avenue in our city be highlighted which ends at the Menorah that the Mayor purchased,  our Santa which is over 60 years old, and the park that we have every year and our Christmas Tree. I think it's important that Miracle Mile be highlighted going forward.  So that' s what I would like to see going forward,  it's just an improvement.  I know that we did in the past rely on the BID for some of this as well, but I think I would like to see an improvement.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago: Mr. Manager,  if I may. Belkys, you and I have talked on multiple occasions in regard to we received some emails and some kudos from business owners and people who have visited in regard to how much better the holiday decorations looked this year in comparison to past years, correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago: Just to give a little bit of background,  because I know that two of the Commissioners were not here when this happened.  When the BID was basically removed from the picture,  we were in the process of working with them to come to an agreement and we had to scramble to pick up the pieces.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  We had two weeks to put it together.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two weeks.  Your team did a wonderful job,  along with the Manager.  This was basically like a dry run the first year. In regard to the Santa Clause,  you want to replace the Santa Clause.  I probably received five emails from people saying that the Santa Clause is historic and don' t touch my Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Who wants to replace it?\n\nMayor Lago:  I don' t know. I'm just telling you. You said something about the 60-year-old Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, I said leading up to it. We should make sure that the avenue leading to all of our historic decorations and the Menorah,  it needs to measure up, because…\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I thought you wanted to replace the Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Not at all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I just love him.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There was a request to render it historic and to that point,  I think we need to do something to protect it, because it' s kind of just out in the open on a corner.  We need to make sure there' s something in front of it protecting it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Besides that. How much did we spend on the park in the last three years?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  On the park or on Miracle Mile?\n\nMayor Lago:  No, no. Miracle Mile is another thing. On the park.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I don' t know.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  I know it was a big investment.  Mr. Manager,  we hadn' t changed the decorations in decades,  correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  We changed it about three years\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F-5<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item labeled F-5 discussed during the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning Christmas decorations on Miracle Mile.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>01_09_2024 - Verbatim Transcripts - F-5.pdf<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Filename and document identifier for the verbatim transcript covering agenda item F-5 from the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>01.09.2024<|>MEETING<|>Date of the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting where agenda item F-5 was discussed.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The governing body of Coral Gables responsible for city decisions and meetings.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Vince Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor of Coral Gables presiding over the January 9, 2024 meeting and participant in the discussion of agenda item F-5.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor of Coral Gables participating in the January 9, 2024 meeting and discussion of agenda item F-5.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Melissa Castro<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables attending the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables who sponsored agenda item F-5 and led the discussion regarding Christmas decorations on Miracle Mile.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Kirk Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables attending the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Attorney Cristina Suárez<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias<|>PERSON<|>City Manager present at the January 9, 2024 meeting, involved in discussion about decorations and budget.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Clerk Billy Urquia<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Economic Development Director Belkys Perez<|>PERSON<|>Economic Development Director who discussed the logistics and efforts related to Miracle Mile decorations during the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Business Improvement District (BID)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization previously responsible for Miracle Mile decorations, removed from the process prior to the 2023 holiday season.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Miracle Mile Christmas Decorations<|>PROJECT<|>Project concerning the holiday decorations on Miracle Mile discussed under agenda item F-5, including issues with timing, lighting, and historic elements like the Santa Claus and Menorah.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Santa Claus<|>PROJECT<|>Historic Christmas decoration over 60 years old on Miracle Mile, discussed in relation to preservation and protection during agenda item F-5.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Menorah<|>PROJECT<|>Historic decoration purchased by the Mayor, located on Miracle Mile, part of the holiday decorations discussed in agenda item F-5.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Christmas Tree Park<|>PROJECT<|>Park area with Christmas Tree decorations on Miracle Mile, part of the holiday decorations discussed in agenda item F-5.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-5<|>Miracle Mile Christmas Decorations<|>Agenda item F-5 is directly about the Miracle Mile Christmas Decorations project and its improvement.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-5<|>Santa Claus<|>Agenda item F-5 discussion included the historic Santa Claus decoration and its preservation.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-5<|>Menorah<|>Agenda item F-5 discussion referenced the Menorah as a key historic decoration on Miracle Mile.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-5<|>Christmas Tree Park<|>Agenda item F-5 included discussion about the Christmas Tree Park decorations.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Economic Development Director Belkys Perez<|>Miracle Mile Christmas Decorations<|>Belkys Perez led the team responsible for organizing the Miracle Mile decorations after the BID was removed.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Vince Lago<|>Santa Claus<|>Mayor purchased the Menorah and commented on the historic Santa Claus decoration during the meeting.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Business Improvement District (BID)<|>Miracle Mile Christmas Decorations<|>BID was previously responsible for Miracle Mile decorations but was removed prior to the 2023 season.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>01_09_2024 - Verbatim Transcripts - F-5.pdf<|>F-5<|>The document identified by this filename is the verbatim transcript of the meeting discussing agenda item F-5.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>01.09.2024<|>F-5<|>The meeting held on January 9, 2024, included discussion of agenda item F-5.<|>10)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
