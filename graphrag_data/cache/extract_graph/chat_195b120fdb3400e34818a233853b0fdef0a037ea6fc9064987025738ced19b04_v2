relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

And I think it' s not fair to penalize the nonprofit school and institution that lives there,  but rather we should try to work as a community,  both the City and the church and school, to see if we can find a way to alleviate the parking on swales.   I brought --  because I want you to know the school tries very hard to make sure that parents don' t park in the swale.   That doesn' t mean they don' t, but they try very hard.   And I just brought two samples of newsletters.   So, this newsletter is published monthly,  and it goes out to all the school parents,  and I highlighted -there' s a whole section on parking.   I'm going to pass these around.   So,  it's not something that they say once at the beginning of the school year during orientation and just say,  okay,  we hope you guys pay attention to it.  No, they' re reminded on a regular basis,  and I can tell you that the Ed Diaz,  who' s chief of operations,  has been called by nearby residents to ask parents to,  you know,  leave the driveway or whatever. So,  we' re well aware of it and we try working hard to prevent it from happening.   But I think the burden of landscaping and maintaining non-adjacent neighbors is just -seems more like a penalty to a school. If I were asking for an increase in students,  I would say,  yeah,  of course,  because we' re going to now have a bigger impact on the community.   We' re bringing more cars to the area with more students.   But we still have the same students,  the same number of students for the last 22 years.   So, let me pass this around.\n\nCommissioner Castro: Since this is a quasi- judicial item,  I would like to disclose that I have received emails regarding this item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I've received emails as well.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Same here, so have I.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think everybody has,  so moving on.\n\nMs. Russo:  Alright,  so I respectfully request that you approve the proposal for the new building along with the staff-imposed conditions and eliminate the condition of landscaping the properties between Coral Way and Andalusia on Cordova.  And we' re here to answer any questions you may have, and I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal,  if necessary.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Director,  how are you?\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Good,  thank you.   Good morning,  Jennifer Garcia,  Planning Official.  If I could have the PowerPoint,  please.  Okay,  so we' re here for a major amendment to the approved 2002 site plan for St. Philip' s School.   As indicated,  this site is south of Coral Way to the east of\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nColumbus,  north of Andalusia,  and to just west of Cordova.  This is an aerial of the campus.  We' re talking about just the southeast portion of the campus,  which is now an existing house typology which was converted into a preschool.   So, the future land use designation is religious institutional use.   The zoning is special use.   So,  the Ordinance Number 3576 is what approved the site plan. And then there' s conditions regarding any changes to the site plan would have to require Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission review and approval,  as well as the no openings on the east fa√ßade. So,  again,  we' re talking about the southeast portion of the site and looking at the proposed building,  it would have classrooms one and two for preschool on the front, the back-ofhouse equipment is located west of the building away from the single- family adjacent house, restored swale on the front of the structure of the proposed preschool building,  a front yard.   The storage is going to be acting as a buffer between the existing home to the east and the actual preschool area,  and in the back is a multi-purpose room and playground.   Here' s a rendering of what that looks like.  Again,  this was approved by the Board of Architects.   It went to DRC back in April of last year.   Board of Architects,  a couple of times, and approval in August.   They had a neighborhood meeting in October. Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval in November,  and here we are for first reading at City Commission.   So, the letters were sent to the property within a thousand feet as required by code,  and that happened three times so far.  It was posted twice,  three times website posting and once for newspaper advertisements. So,  staff has determined that it' s consistent with the comp plan and it complies with all the findings of fact, which is part of your packet and the staff report today.   So,  there' s two conditions of approval. The first one is the non-operable fixed windows on the fa√ßade facing the adjacent abutting neighbor to the east.   The swale improvements on the front, and as she indicated,  the Planning and Zoning Board wanted to expand that and have it on Cordova as well between Coral Way and Andalusia to prevent parking and other issues that the school,  I guess,  has been dealing with for quite some time.  And all the conditions that are listed in Ordinance Number 3576 would still remain in effect. That' s it\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_195b120fdb3400e34818a233853b0fdef0a037ea6fc9064987025738ced19b04_v2"}
