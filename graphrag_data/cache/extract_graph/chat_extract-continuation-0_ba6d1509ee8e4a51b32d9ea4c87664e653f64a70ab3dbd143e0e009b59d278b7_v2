It's just a matter of scheduling.  I deal with schedules every single day when I'm dealing with courts and various people come in and any time that you ignore the overwhelming desire of the Police and Fire people to be recognized in a general meeting where everybody is there,  as opposed to just a resident showing up. And I'm not talking about whether or not this Commission shows up. I'm talking about whether residents are seeing what' s going on, then it is a second- class designation that you give to somebody when they are not in a general meeting itself,  because that' s the purpose here,  to recognize.  You don' t recognize somebody by not including them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think second class is also stating an 11 a.m. time certain,  not taking the item until 11:57. Like we did today to give preference to another item, because we had folks from the Chamber here.  We' re bordering on just choosing who we want to select as first class\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ncitizens when we are saying,  we' re going to stop the discussion on this item which everybody was listening to and we had members in the room who were here to speak on the item,  residents, because we had one person who we wanted to discuss one item on and we decided to take that item first. Again, I'm happy moving forward with this. I do not believe that any employee is going to tell you that they believe they' re second class citizens,  because we' re doing a special ceremony to recognize them and I'm happy to make a motion to move this forward.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you make your motion.  I think also what you' re not recognizing is that you mentioned that we' re not following the schedule,  we' re not keeping time certain.  We had one item that was time certain today, and the conversation ran long in regard to the school,  but let' s be also very clear. We' re also incredibly lenient, incredibly lenient on the time that we give to all residents that speak. The gentleman who spoke not once,  but two times on the same issue, which is something that we don' t have to do, spoke for probably twelve minutes,  because I was looking at one point, he had gone over by three or four minutes,  which is perfectly fine. He had spent a huge amount of time working on that presentation.  If we were to do things like other cities,  and by the way,  I think we' re the only city in Miami-Dade County that gives this much deference and this much time to talk. Some of the things I was trying to get things in line in regard to public comment, again,  not stripping public comment,  we tried that. We tried to get it in line, but we give so much time in public comment that the meetings last very, very, long, very, very long, delaying,  and then we also have case in point, we have actual debates up here, Madam City Attorney, we have debates. We just had those nice family members,  the Toyos were having a full-fist conversation with the representative for the school,  along with our staff and we were going back and forth. As you know, correct me if I'm wrong, does that happen in any other city that you are aware of?\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  I can' t say Mayor.  We are very lenient,  or I should say very flexible in public comment and extending time for members of the public to speak.\n\nMayor Lago:  Madam City Attorney,  I know that you want to be respectful as possible.  You know the answer is no. The bottom line is very simple.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It's not the answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is the answer.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not a yes or no answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is a yes or no answer,  Commissioner,  it is, because what ends up happening and I'll give you an explanation.  You know this very well because you visited many cities. What ends up happening is that they give you a public comment section at the beginning of the Commission, in the City of Miami,  Miami- Dade County,  other municipalities.  You speak about your issue and the item is presented,  and the Commission deliberates,  and we come to a conclusion.  There' s no back and forth. I've seen other cities the way they do it. I'm not saying that we do it the right way and they do it the wrong way or we do it the wrong way and they do it the right way.  I'm just\n\nsaying that we spend a lot of time giving a lot of public comments.  I think that Commissioner Menendez -  you talk about finding a middle ground,  you talk about to being on both ends of the discussion and taking a little bit from here and a little bit from here.  If you want to move forward on this, that' s fine, but why don' t we apply what Commissioner Menendez said which is, we do a little bit in the morning and we do a little bit in the afternoon,  and that way we address both issues and I'm willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning.  I think that' s perfectly fine, if you want to do it then.  I'll be willing to meet here at 8:30, it's not a precedent,  we did it under Raul, and it worked perfectly well. I never had an issue with it and the entire Commission was present,  all the employees liked it\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>MEETING<|>A meeting of the City Commission where discussions about scheduling, public comment, and recognition of Police and Fire personnel took place, involving Commissioners Fernandez, Menendez, Mayor Lago, City Attorney Suarez, and other participants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a member of the City Commission, who expressed concerns about scheduling, time certain items, and the recognition of Police and Fire personnel during the City Commission Meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the Mayor presiding over the City Commission Meeting, who defended the current public comment procedures and scheduling flexibility, and engaged in discussion with Commissioner Fernandez and City Attorney Suarez.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Suarez, the City Attorney present at the City Commission Meeting, who described the City as very lenient and flexible regarding public comment and extending speaking time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a member of the City Commission referenced by Mayor Lago as advocating for a middle ground approach to public comment scheduling during the City Commission Meeting.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Commissioner Fernandez participated and spoke during the City Commission Meeting, expressing views on scheduling and recognition.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Mayor Lago<|>Mayor Lago presided over and actively participated in the City Commission Meeting discussions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>City Attorney Suarez provided legal perspective and commentary during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Commissioner Menendez was referenced during the City Commission Meeting as proposing a compromise on public comment scheduling.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Mayor Lago and Commissioner Fernandez engaged in a direct dialogue about scheduling, public comment, and recognition issues during the City Commission Meeting.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>Mayor Lago asked City Attorney Suarez about practices in other cities regarding public comment, eliciting a response.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Mayor Lago referenced Commissioner Menendez's suggestion about splitting public comment times to address scheduling concerns.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
