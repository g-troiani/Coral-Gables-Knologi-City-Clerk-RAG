The Act mandates local governments to amend zoning codes, particularly by easing parking requirements and allowing increased building heights and densities near major transit stops. Key entities include the Live Local Act itself, Senate Bill 102 (its legislative identifier), local zoning elements such as height and density limitations, the three mixed-use districts (MX1, MX2, MX3) where affordable housing is targeted, and the GIS Team of Coral Gables, which supports implementation through mapping and analysis. Relationships among these entities reveal the Act’s overriding influence on local zoning rules and the concerns raised by Commissioner Menendez regarding the reliance on potentially impermanent transit stops. Overall, the community reflects a legislative and technical framework aimed at addressing affordable housing challenges through regulatory reform and spatial analysis.\",\n  \"rating\": 7.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is relatively high due to the Live Local Act’s significant preemption of local zoning laws, its potential to reshape urban development patterns in Coral Gables, and the substantial funding and policy implications involved.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Live Local Act as the central legislative driver\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Live Local Act (Chapter 2023-17) is the pivotal entity in this community, representing a state law enacted to address Florida’s affordable housing crisis by mandating local governments to amend zoning codes. It specifically requires consideration or allowance of reduced parking requirements for affordable housing projects near major transit stops, facilitating transit-oriented development. The Act also authorizes the development of affordable housing units under these revised standards and became effective on July 1, 2023. This legislation preempts several local zoning regulations in Coral Gables, including height and density limitations, to enable more flexible development standards. The Act’s centrality is underscored by its multiple relationships with other entities such as Senate Bill 102 (its legislative identifier), height and density limitations, and mixed-use districts where affordable housing is targeted [Data: Entities (557, 602); Relationships (815, 818, 816, 819, 779)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Senate Bill 102 as the legislative basis for the Live Local Act\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Senate Bill No. 102 is the formal legislative designation of the Live Local Act, effective July 1, 2023. This bill addresses the state’s affordable housing crisis by preempting local zoning regulations and unlocking access to over $800 million in funding for affordable housing initiatives. The bill’s passage signifies a strong state-level commitment to reforming local land use policies to promote affordable housing development. Its direct equivalence to the Live Local Act links the legislative process to the practical zoning changes mandated in Coral Gables and other jurisdictions [Data: Entities (602); Relationships (815)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Preemption of local height limitations in Coral Gables\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Live Local Act preempts existing local height limitations in Coral Gables, specifically for the mixed-use districts MX2 and MX3. Previously, MX2 had a height limit of 70 feet and MX3 had a limit of 150 feet. Under the Act, developments in these districts are allowed to build up to the highest height within a one-mile radius of the development site, effectively relaxing height restrictions to encourage affordable housing projects. This preemption is significant because it overrides local zoning controls to facilitate denser, taller developments near transit hubs, which is a key strategy for increasing affordable housing supply. The GIS Team supports this process by providing detailed maps showing these height limitations and radius analyses [Data: Entities (607, 606); Relationships (818, 821)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Modification of density limitations citywide\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Density limitations in Coral Gables, which previously capped development at a maximum of 125 units per acre citywide, are also preempted by the Live Local Act. The Act requires a citywide analysis of density specifically for affordable housing developments, allowing for more flexible density standards to promote higher housing unit counts. This change is critical for enabling affordable housing projects to achieve viable scale and financial feasibility. The density preemption complements the height preemption and parking reductions to create a more permissive regulatory environment for affordable housing [Data: Entities (608); Relationships (819)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Targeting of mixed-use districts for affordable housing\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Live Local Act specifically applies to affordable housing developments within three mixed-use zoning districts in Coral Gables: MX1, MX2, and MX3. These districts cover strategic geographic areas including the northern city along 8th Street (MX1), Ponce de Leon Boulevard and downtown area (MX3), and the Design and Innovation District along U.S.-1 and the urban center near the City of South Miami. By focusing on these mixed-use districts, the Act promotes transit-oriented and mixed-use development patterns that integrate affordable housing with commercial and innovation hubs. This targeted approach aligns with broader urban planning goals to increase housing supply near transit and employment centers [Data: Entities (603); Relationships (816)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Role of the GIS Team in supporting implementation\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The GIS Team of Coral Gables plays a technical and supportive role in the implementation of the Live Local Act by providing detailed maps and spatial analyses.

The GIS Team’s work ensures that developers, planners, and policymakers have the necessary geographic information to understand where and how the Act’s preemptions apply, facilitating compliance and informed decision-making.

Specifically, the concern is that some bus stops may be removed in the future, which could undermine the Act’s intended impact on affordable housing development near transit. This raises questions about the long-term stability and effectiveness of the Act’s provisions tied to transit infrastructure, suggesting a potential risk in policy design that depends on transit stop permanence.
