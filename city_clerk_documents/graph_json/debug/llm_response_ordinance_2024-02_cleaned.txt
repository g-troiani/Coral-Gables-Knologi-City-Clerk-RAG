Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the Coral Gables ordinance document 2024-02. The instructions say to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the format AGENDA_ITEM: [code]. If there's none, say NOT_FOUND.

First, I'll start skimming the document. The main body of the ordinance usually has sections like WHEREAS clauses, the actual amendments, and then the sections. The agenda item code might be somewhere in the adoption section or at the end where the vote happened.

Looking at the end of the document, there's a section after the vote details. Let me check the pages. The third page has the signatures and some details. Scanning through page 3, I see a line that says "Agendanitem: E-2)" right after the vote details. Wait, the exact line is "Agendaitem: E-2)" maybe with a typo in "AgendaItem: E-2". 

Wait, in the user's provided text, on page 2 of 3, near the end, after the vote (Yeas: Anderson, Castro, etc.), there's a line: "AgendaItem: E-2)". That's probably the code. Let me confirm. The user's document text shows:

"Unanimous: 5-0Vote) 
AgendaItem: E-2) 
APPROVED: 
VINCELAGO
MAYOR"

Yes, that's the line. The code is E-2. So the correct format is AGENDA_ITEM: E-2. I need to make sure there's no other code elsewhere. Scanning the rest of the document, the other sections are about the sections being amended, but no other agenda item codes mentioned. So the answer is E-2.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-2
