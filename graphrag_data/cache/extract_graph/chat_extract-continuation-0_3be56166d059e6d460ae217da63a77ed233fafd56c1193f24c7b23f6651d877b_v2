strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

I think that Commissioner Menendez -  you talk about finding a middle ground,  you talk about to being on both ends of the discussion and taking a little bit from here and a little bit from here.  If you want to move forward on this, that' s fine, but why don' t we apply what Commissioner Menendez said which is, we do a little bit in the morning and we do a little bit in the afternoon,  and that way we address both issues and I'm willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning.  I think that' s perfectly fine, if you want to do it then.  I'll be willing to meet here at 8:30, it's not a precedent,  we did it under Raul, and it worked perfectly well. I never had an issue with it and the entire Commission was present,  all the employees liked it. So, I'm just telling you, meet us halfway so that we can get this done and move on to leave here by 2:30.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  Commissioner Menendez and Commissioner Fernandez,  would you be open to the idea of maybe having this first ceremony and then see what the input of the employees is, if they like it or not.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I think we' ve already done that though.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  No, no, no. The actual ceremony.  Not asking the question with however we word the survey questions,  actually having it, then being in it, and then deciding,  yes,  I like this more or no, I don' t like this more.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  That' s a pilot.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm not in favor of that.  I think it would be great to just do what Commissioner Menendez said and we move on.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I like the option that Commissioner Menendez suggested. Let' s try to organize our schedule better.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'm fine with starting earlier,  but I know there are folks that drop off their kids and that time is precious to a lot of people,  and we' re already here and staff included.  I would like the pilot to be morning and then like 12:30, see how it goes.  If we get through it fast, great,  if not, then I'm going to support a different option,  but I look to you and the administration to identify how you group them. If it was me, I would group morning certain types and afternoons time certain,  a certain time, and see if we move things forward.  I'm just - if it doesn' t work, then I'm going back to my original.\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  We can certainly look into that. I like the idea of maybe employees in the morning,  most of our employees do start at 8 in the morning.  So, we can have the employees easily here at 8 or at 8:30 in the morning,  and then maybe our standard protocols in the afternoon. We can certainly try something and if an employee works in the afternoon,  then maybe we can move that employee for the 12 o' clock slot.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago: I'm happy you mentioned that, because I was going to mention that to Commissioner Fernandez.  Our city starts at 8 o' clock in the morning,  we can start at 9 o' clock.  So, at the end of the day, the employees are here. So, to me, if we have it at 8 o' clock it's even better, because they get to work even faster.  That was one of the issues that we had when Mayor Valdes-Fauli was doing it.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I want to sweeten the pot.  Just because.  We' ve had that conversation before on another topic, maybe we can have 12:30 protocol and take a break for lunch.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s how I sweeten the pot.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There used to be a time certain 12:30 for lunch. What happened to that?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Well, that' s what I'm trying to bring back.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach hasn' t forgotten about it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I know, but that was approved,  and it just was done away with.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  If it's okay, it's not my item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That really sweetens the pot - 12:30 time certain.  My stomach approves.\n\nLaughter]\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I agree with that one.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I think I'm hypo-glycemic right now.\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we do this. Why don' t we, at the next Commission meeting,  put together something that deals with the morning and an afternoon session,  and we' ll see how that goes with the approval of the Commission through the Manager and we find a solution for that.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  So,  I guess what you' re suggesting is, at 9 a.m. we start with presentation and protocol.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  9:30 we do time certain public comment.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we go earlier. Why don' t we do 8:30? Why not?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Because there are members of staff are coming not from here, there are members of staff\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a member of the City Commission who suggests finding a middle ground by splitting sessions between morning and afternoon, proposes starting meetings early and reviving a 12:30 time certain lunch break protocol.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, a member of the City Commission who proposes having a first ceremony to gather employee input before deciding on scheduling preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, a member of the City Commission who supports Commissioner Menendez's suggestion to organize the schedule better and recalls prior approval of a 12:30 time certain lunch break.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a member of the City Commission who supports starting earlier but is mindful of staff with childcare responsibilities, suggests a pilot with morning and 12:30 sessions, and recalls the previous 12:30 time certain lunch break that was discontinued.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the Mayor of Coral Gables, who prefers following Commissioner Menendez's suggestion to split sessions between morning and afternoon, supports starting meetings earlier (8 or 8:30 a.m.), and proposes putting together a plan for morning and afternoon sessions at the next Commission meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELEJABARRIETA<|>PERSON<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta, who supports the idea of scheduling employees in the morning starting at 8 or 8:30 a.m. and suggests moving afternoon employees to a 12 o'clock slot to accommodate scheduling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting where Commissioners and staff discuss scheduling options for meetings, including morning and afternoon sessions, employee input ceremonies, and time certain lunch breaks.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>LAGO<|>Mayor Lago supports Commissioner Menendez's suggestion to split sessions between morning and afternoon and start meetings earlier, as stated: \"I think it would be great to just do what Commissioner Menendez said and we move on.\" <|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>ANDERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson likes the option suggested by Commissioner Menendez to organize the schedule better, as stated: \"I like the option that Commissioner Menendez suggested.\" <|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>FERNANDEZ<|>Commissioner Fernandez discusses the pilot idea related to morning and 12:30 sessions, which aligns with Commissioner Menendez's proposal to split sessions, indicating related scheduling ideas. <|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELEJABARRIETA<|>MENENDEZ<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta supports the scheduling idea proposed by Commissioner Menendez to have employees in the morning and afternoon slots, as stated: \"I like the idea of maybe employees in the morning... and then maybe our standard protocols in the afternoon.\" <|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CASTRO<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>Commissioner Castro proposes having a first ceremony to gather employee input during the City Commission Meeting, as stated: \"would you be open to the idea of maybe having this first ceremony and then see what the input of the employees is.\" <|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>Mayor Lago leads and participates in the City Commission Meeting discussions about scheduling and protocols, as indicated by multiple statements during the meeting. <|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>ANDERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez and Vice Mayor Anderson both recall and discuss the previously approved 12:30 time certain lunch break, indicating shared knowledge and concern about this protocol. <|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>ANDERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez and Vice Mayor Anderson discuss the 12:30 time certain lunch break protocol, with Menendez trying to bring it back and Anderson approving it humorously. <|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>MENENDEZ<|>Mayor Lago agrees to put together a plan at the next Commission meeting based on Commissioner Menendez's suggestion for morning and afternoon sessions, as stated: \"Why don' t we, at the next Commission meeting, put together something that deals with the morning and an afternoon session.\" <|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
