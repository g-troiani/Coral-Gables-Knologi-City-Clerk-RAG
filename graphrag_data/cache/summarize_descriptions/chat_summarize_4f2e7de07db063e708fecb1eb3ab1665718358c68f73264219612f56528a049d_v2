One key ordinance under Agenda Item E-6 involves text amendments to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code, specifically amending Article 10, titled \"Parking and Access.\" This amendment focuses on reducing parking requirements for affordable housing developments located near major transit stops, in accordance with the 2023-17 Laws of Florida. The ordinance includes standard provisions such as a repealer clause, severability clause, codification, and an effective date to ensure proper implementation and legal clarity.\n\nAdditionally, another ordinance under Agenda Item E-6 pertains to zoning district boundary changes pursuant to Article 14, Section 14-212 of the Zoning Code. This ordinance involves rezoning Lots 8 through 21, excluding the west half of Lot 8 in Block 29 of the Crafts Section, changing the zoning designation from Mixed-Use 1 (MX1) District to Mixed-Use 3 (MX3) District. The affected properties include addresses at 3000 Ponce de Leon Blvd, 216 and 224 Catalonia, 203 University Dr, and 225 Malaga. This ordinance also contains repealer and severability provisions along with an effective date. Notably, the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) did not provide a recommendation on this matter during their meeting on December 13, 2013, resulting in a tied vote of 3-3.\n\nThe Agenda Item E-6 ordinances are identified by document numbers 23-6705 and 23-6827 in City of Coral Gables records, reflecting their formal processing and referencing in official meeting texts. Together, these ordinances demonstrate the City Commission’s efforts to update zoning regulations to support affordable housing initiatives near transit hubs and to adjust zoning boundaries to better align with community development goals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844107, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 388, "prompt_tokens": 517, "total_tokens": 905, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
