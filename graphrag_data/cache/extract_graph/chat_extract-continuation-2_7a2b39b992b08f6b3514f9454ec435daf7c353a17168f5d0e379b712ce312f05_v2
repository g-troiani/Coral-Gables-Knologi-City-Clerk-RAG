We did ask for the $79,000 that it would cost to complete that project,  and so,  I did receive that.  That is going to be a project that' s going to start in February.  We didn' t want to do it in the middle of the holiday season,  because we weren' t sure when it would be done, and so because our budget just started in October,  we wanted to have enough time to be able to have it. So that' s a year- round lighting that would be installed,  and we have talked to that vendor,  and they know that they need to go up some of the branches.  I'm not sure how many string lights were purchased,  because it' s not our project,  but we want to go up.\n\nMayor Lago:  But this is something that we' ve been talking about,  Commissioner,  for two years. I know the BID fell apart and everything that happened,  but I want to make sure that we deliver on that this year, if possible.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I had a lot of feedback and even in our comments in the community and I think the Mayor was touching upon it. I would love to have Miracle Mile be a go-to place in the holiday season for folks to come to Miracle Mile to see.  In my perfect world, Miracle Mile should glow during the winter, during the holidays,  glow, and people like, hey, let' s drive to Coral Gables Miracle Mile so we can just see how beautifully lit and create sort of a winter wonderland concept. I think that' s what -  without that we can put all the decorations possible on trees and it will look like Charlie Brown' s Christmas Tree which sort of you know,  tips over.  I would like to create, what is it, the wow. I want people to feel wow and the lighting is the key,  I think,  and since the Mayor did mention that we have Commissioner Castro,  Commissioner Fernandez weren' t here when the whole BID, not now, but could you or somebody maybe in February give a history of the responsibilities for Miracle Mile and how we now transition to the city doing it. So,  I think I want to fill in any gaps,  because now, obviously,  we' re tasked with it and we all want to put our best foot forward,  but if you could do just a brief how we got here, that would be helpful.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  So, I'm going to dovetail. As I handed out to you, this was a communication with residents,  and it was on Next-door, so I want to make sure…\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Very popular topic on Next-door.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I make sure I put my communications back to the residents.  What they would like, the main complaint there was lack of color.  This was an invitation that I sent to them to participate and there is a willingness of residents to participate,  but our history on trying to do something with Miracle Mile goes back when the BID was here,  Slesnick came in and visited every single one of us who was in office at the time,  basically imploring us to dress up Miracle Mile. I brought in pictures from Winter Park' s main drag,  showing what they had done.  People want some color, people want some flash to show there, but we don' t want it too bright either.  So, maybe I don' t know if we need to dim down some of the other lights so that the decorations are the showcase.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  No sunglasses needed.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No sunglasses needed.  So,  some of those vertical poles when we talked about Calvin rating, I don' t know if we can either through a film or something to kind of tone them down a little bit so its not hard to look at, so that the lights on the trees and the decorations on the trees are the center of focus,  as opposed to the glare that you get from some of the lights on the Mile in one corner and some of the crosswalk areas.  So, I just wanted to share this communication with you all, with the residents,  they are interested in participating.  You might get a reach out from them saying,  here' s our ideas and we all collaborate and get a better pizza, so-to-speak.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I also think it' s important to keep in mind that while we want something at night, we do need to get a good bang for our dollar too, and make sure that they are really impactful in the daytime.  Just keep that in mind as well,  because we do have a big population in the daytime,  and we want to make sure that they enjoy it also.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Thank you.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT<|>PROJECT<|>A project scheduled to start in February involving year-round lighting installation on Miracle Mile, with a budget request of $79,000 to complete it.
