relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nEntity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION\nText: \"Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed. This is Ordinance 2024-01.\"\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, which is the same as Ordinance 2024-01 and amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, also known as agenda item E-1, which amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same as<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Real Data-\nEntity types: agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project\nText: Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Okay.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   And anyone else who would like to join.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   So, I would like, if we can do it in the next 30 days,  just to have that conversation.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   I know staff will be working on the Code Enforcement portion of it so that we can,  when we bring it back,  we can have your input taken into account as well.   I know Mr. Trowbridge also told me he wanted a little more time to have conversations with the members. So, always willing to listen to what our business community' s needs are.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Thank you, Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And thank you, Mr. Chamizo and Mr. Adams for being here as well. And the members who actually --  who sent emails.\n\nMr. Chamizo:  One final item,  Manny Chamizo,  once again. Echoing Commissioner -Kirk' s comment,  there are a number of signs that are currently out of compliance. I can tell you,  I've been here 41 years, I'm sure you' ve been here just as long.  Neon signs, you know that neon signs are not supposed to be on the windows.   They' re there.   I mean,  I see them.   They' re supposed to be, I believe, you can correct me if I'm wrong, I believe it has to be six feet from the actual window. You can have neon, just can' t have it up in windows.   There are hundreds of violations.   So, that' s why I'm kind of like, hey man, what happened?   You know, why are we --?   Are we going to go out there now, we' re going to go with, you know, an actual measuring stick and start measuring if we are two inches above or one quarter of an inch, because there' s so many violations.   So, I think that the first thing,  if you want to start cracking down on signs,  start cracking down on all signs. And then we can start focusing in on the commercial real estate signs,  which may or may not be in compliance.   Thank you again.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I mean,  well,  I appreciate that.   And I think that Code Enforcement should do a better job of enforcing.   I think that the conversation here is specifically about the real estate signs and I think the focus of what Commissioner Menendez was saying was about the real estate signs.   So, that being said,  I guess I'll defer the item.\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay, thank you.  Moving on to -- thank you for being here.   I appreciate it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, involving discussions among commissioners and city staff regarding code enforcement and signage compliance issues, particularly focusing on real estate signs and neon signs violations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER_FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, participant in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting, advocating for timely conversations within 30 days and emphasizing the need for input on Code Enforcement related to signage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS_HERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Ms. Hernandez, participant in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting, responding affirmatively to Commissioner Fernandez's requests and facilitating discussion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR_TROWBRIDGE<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Trowbridge, mentioned by Commissioner Fernandez as wanting more time to have conversations with members of the business community regarding Code Enforcement matters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR_CHAMIZO<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Manny Chamizo, participant in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting, speaking about signage violations, specifically neon signs and commercial real estate signs, and urging consistent enforcement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER_MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, referenced by Commissioner Fernandez as focusing on real estate signs in the signage enforcement discussion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting, acknowledging speakers and moving the meeting forward.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>COMMISSIONER_FERNANDEZ<|>Commissioner Fernandez participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, contributing to discussions on Code Enforcement and signage.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MS_HERNANDEZ<|>Ms. Hernandez participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, responding to Commissioner Fernandez and facilitating discussion.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MR_TROWBRIDGE<|>Mr. Trowbridge was referenced during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, as wanting more time to consult with business community members.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MR_CHAMIZO<|>Mr. Chamizo spoke at the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, about signage violations and enforcement concerns.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>COMMISSIONER_MENENDEZ<|>Commissioner Menendez was referenced during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, regarding focus on real estate signs enforcement.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>Mayor Lago presided over the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, managing the meeting proceedings.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER_FERNANDEZ<|>MR_TROWBRIDGE<|>Commissioner Fernandez mentioned Mr. Trowbridge as wanting more time to have conversations with business community members about Code Enforcement.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER_FERNANDEZ<|>MR_CHAMIZO<|>Commissioner Fernandez thanked Mr. Chamizo for his participation and comments regarding signage enforcement.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER_FERNANDEZ<|>COMMISSIONER_MENENDEZ<|>Commissioner Fernandez referenced Commissioner Menendez's focus on real estate signs during the discussion on signage enforcement.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MR_CHAMIZO<|>COMMISSIONER_FERNANDEZ<|>Mr. Chamizo echoed concerns that Commissioner Fernandez acknowledged regarding signage violations and enforcement.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
