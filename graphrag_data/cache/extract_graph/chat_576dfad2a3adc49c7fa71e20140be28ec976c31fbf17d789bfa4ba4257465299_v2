So, its planting,  location,  and conditions,  and soils,  and all those things that go into whether or not they will survive.  So, I did see live oaks out in El Paso when I was there, so I don' t know if its really necessarily the heat level or the lack of a freeze,  I guess some research that someone would\n\nhave to do on whether or not they need a freeze,  but I know that that' s true with many other varieties of trees and why we can' t grow Sycamores down here and so forth.  It's not because it doesn' t get hot elsewhere.  It was 102 degrees in Chicago one year.  It's not the heat so much,  its does that tree require a freeze and where is it planted.  So, it was a brutal summer.  My kids wanted to go shopping.  Is it air-conditioned was the only question I kept asking them.  So,  yes,  looking forward to the trees getting planted.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  So, what I would like to see done is just have a conversation with Dr. Feely and report back to us on what recommendations he would have.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn: Absolutely. I'm familiar with Dr.  Feely' s research. Our arborist,  our senior arborist and I have looked into it. We' ve read his articles.\n\nMayor Lago:  You' ve already incorporated some of his guidance,  right.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Yes. So basically,  just in a nutshell,  I don' t want to take too much time, but this concern is due to climate change.  Any tropical tree species migrating up to different areas and as we have a heat change in temperature,  he was concerned live oaks might migrate further north,  because they are not a tropical species.  But in our tree succession planning and here' s our list,  and also,  we had zoning code changes this year,  it encourages more tree diversity and we' re following a lot more tree diversity and here' s the list if anyone' s interested, but you can see a big variety of different natives,  flowering trees with a few oaks,  because oaks are still very viable today.  They are the most sustainable tree.  Our senior arborist stands by them. They are so resilient in hurricanes.  You can see the longevity of them in urban areas. Look at Coral Way,  they' ve been here 80-100 years.  Today,  they are still viable and so,  the concept of what' s going to happen in the future because of unknown climate change is good research to be familiar with, there are so many different opinions on it. So that' s where we are.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I appreciate it.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Sure.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_576dfad2a3adc49c7fa71e20140be28ec976c31fbf17d789bfa4ba4257465299_v2"}
