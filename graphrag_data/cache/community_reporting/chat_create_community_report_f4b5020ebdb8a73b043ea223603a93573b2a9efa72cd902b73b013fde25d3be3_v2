The Act defines criteria for major transit stops, including specific high-frequency bus routes such as Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas, Coral Way, and trolley routes, which influence parking reduction eligibility and accessibility requirements. The ordinance also emphasizes ADA-compliant accessible routes connecting properties to these transit stops. The affected urban areas primarily include Coral Gables and areas near the City of South Miami.

It contains specific requirements related to affordable housing, including provisions codified in Florida Statute 166.0451. The Act establishes criteria for major transit stops and parking reductions, aiming to integrate housing policy with transit accessibility to promote sustainable urban development. This law’s broad scope and legislative backing make it a pivotal entity influencing multiple urban planning and transportation elements in Coral Gables and adjacent areas [Data: Entities (451); Relationships (647)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Definition and role of major transit stops in the ordinance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A key component of the Live Local Act is the definition of what constitutes a major transit stop. This definition is critical because it determines eligibility for parking reductions and influences development standards. The ordinance identifies major transit stops based on the presence of high-frequency bus routes and trolley routes, which serve as transit hubs within the urban area. This focus on transit stops underscores the Act’s intent to encourage transit-oriented development and reduce reliance on private vehicles, thereby supporting affordable housing goals through improved accessibility [Data: Entities (828); Relationships (1220, 1229)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Identification of qualifying high-frequency bus routes\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The ordinance specifically names several high-frequency bus routes that qualify as part of the major transit stop criteria. These include the Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas, and Coral Way bus routes, as well as trolley routes.
