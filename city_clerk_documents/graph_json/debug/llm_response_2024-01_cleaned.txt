Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided document. The instructions say to look everywhere in the document. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

Looking at the first page, there's a lot of "WHEREAS" clauses and sections, but I don't see any mention of an agenda item there. The first page ends with some DocuSign info, but nothing yet. 

Moving to the second page, after the "NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED..." sections, there are sections 1 through 5. Then towards the end, after the dates and votes, I notice a line that says "AgendaItem: E-1)". Wait, that looks like the format they mentioned. Let me check again. 

The exact line is: "AgendaItem: E-1)". The user said to capture it exactly as it appears. The code here is E-1. The parentheses are there, but the code itself is E-1. The example given in the problem includes cases like "Agenda Item: E-2" being E-2, so here it's the same structure. 

I should make sure there's no other instance. Scanning again through the entire text, I don't see any other codes like H-3 or similar. The only one is "AgendaItem: E-1)" so the code is E-1. 

I need to ensure there's no typo. The line is written as "AgendaItem: E-1)" with a space after the colon? Wait, looking again: "AgendaItem: E-1)". The colon is there, but maybe there's a space? Let me check the exact text again. The user's example shows that even if there's a period or other characters, we just take the code part. So the code is E-1. 

No other mentions. So the answer should be E-1.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-1
