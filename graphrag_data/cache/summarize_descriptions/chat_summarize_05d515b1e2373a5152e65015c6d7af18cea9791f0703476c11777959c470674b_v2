Specifically, in the context of posting notices as referenced in Section 101-109, an affidavit includes a declaration by the person who posted the notice, accompanied by a copy of the notice itself, as well as details regarding the date and locations where the notice was posted. This serves as official evidence that the required posting has been completed.\n\nIn addition to its use for notice posting, affidavits play a role in regulatory compliance for educational institutions. For example, an affidavit referenced by Ms. Russo demonstrates that St. Philip's and other schools have adhered to established student enrollment caps. This type of affidavit is typically submitted annually by the school, usually in January, and reports the number of students enrolled. The purpose of this annual affidavit is to confirm compliance with prior approvals and covenants related to student population limits.\n\nOverall, affidavits function as important legal documents that provide verified information to support compliance with various regulatory requirements, including proof of notice posting and adherence to student enrollment restrictions in schools.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840837, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
