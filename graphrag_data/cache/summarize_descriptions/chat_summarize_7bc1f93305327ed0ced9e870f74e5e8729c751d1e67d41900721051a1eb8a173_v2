This method is employed in situations where personal service of notices is not feasible. One common application involves publishing the notice at least twice, with the publications spaced seven days apart, and ensuring the final publication occurs at least 30 days before a required conversion or action. This approach ensures adequate public awareness and compliance with legal requirements.\n\nAdditionally, newspaper publication is used to notify the public about proposed rates, fees, and charges related to sewage disposal systems. In this context, a single publication is made in a city newspaper at least ten days prior to the scheduled public hearing date. This notice informs the community about the upcoming hearing and the specific financial changes being considered, allowing stakeholders to prepare and participate in the decision-making process.\n\nOverall, newspaper publication serves as a formal and legally recognized means of disseminating important public notices, particularly when direct personal service is impractical, and plays a crucial role in maintaining transparency and public involvement in governmental and administrative procedures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749563689, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
