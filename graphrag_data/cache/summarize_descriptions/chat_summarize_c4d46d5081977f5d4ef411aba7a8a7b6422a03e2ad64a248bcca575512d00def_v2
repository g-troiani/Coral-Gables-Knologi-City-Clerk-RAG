This permit must be obtained prior to commencing any construction work and is typically valid for less than one year, although extensions may be granted subject to further approvals. The issuance of a construction permit requires approval not only from the city public works department but also from the city commission, trustees of the internal improvement fund, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other relevant state and federal agencies. To qualify for the permit, applicants—often certified contractors—must submit construction plans that comply with all applicable regulations, pay the required permit fees, post a performance bond, and provide certification from a registered engineer.
