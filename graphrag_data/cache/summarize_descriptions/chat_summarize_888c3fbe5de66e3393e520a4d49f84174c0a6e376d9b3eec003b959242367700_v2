It functions actively for 172 days each year and has been involved in significant property developments, including a building demolition and replacement project. The school is subject to enrollment limitations and legal covenants, requiring the submission of annual affidavits to verify student enrollment numbers. \n\nSince purchasing the property in 2016, the SCHOOL has held an educational exemption but faces challenges related to limited parking availability, which has led to neighborhood concerns and discussions involving the City Commission and local residents. To address these issues, the SCHOOL actively communicates with parents through monthly newsletters, emphasizing parking rules and specifically discouraging parking on swales to minimize neighborhood disruption. \n\nThe SCHOOL is also engaged in ongoing site planning efforts, including a master site plan process dating back to 2000, with representation by Ms. Russo. These efforts focus on balancing the school’s operational needs with neighborhood impact and compliance with property use restrictions. The SCHOOL’s proactive involvement in the site plan amendment process and its open communication with the community demonstrate its commitment to maintaining a positive relationship with neighbors while continuing to provide educational services.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749233497, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 336, "total_tokens": 583, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
