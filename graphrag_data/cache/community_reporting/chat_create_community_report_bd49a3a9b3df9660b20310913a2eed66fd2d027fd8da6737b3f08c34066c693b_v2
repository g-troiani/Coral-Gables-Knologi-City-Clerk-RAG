These fines accrue daily on a per pole basis, creating a significant financial incentive for compliance. The fines are directly linked to both failure to remove pole attachments and redundant poles, underscoring their role as a deterrent against prolonged non-compliance.

These poles must be removed within 90 days to avoid code enforcement violations. Their presence indicates legacy infrastructure that poses ongoing compliance challenges. The failure to remove these poles triggers daily accruing fines, which can accumulate rapidly if enforcement deadlines are not met.
