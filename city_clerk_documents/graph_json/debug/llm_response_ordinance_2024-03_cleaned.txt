Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this Coral Gables ordinance document. The user wants only the code in the format AGENDA_ITEM: [code]. Let me start by skimming through the entire document text provided.

First, I'll look for any mention of "Agenda Item" or similar terms. Scanning through the document, I notice towards the end, near the bottom of the text, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-3)". Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Let me check again. Yes, in the section after the voting results, it says "AgendaItem: E-3)". Hmm, but "AgendaItem" is written without a space, but that's probably a typo. Also, the code is E-3. 

I should check if there's another instance. Let me search the entire document again. The user said to search the entire document. Looking through all the pages, the only place where an agenda item is explicitly mentioned is that line. There's another instance on page 2 of 34, where it says "AgendaItem: E-3)" again. 

Other parts mention the ordinance number and sections being amended, but no other agenda codes. The code is consistently E-3 in both instances. Even though there's a typo in "AgendaItem" being written as one word sometimes, the code is E-3. 

No other codes like F-10 or H-1 are present. So the correct code is E-3. I need to make sure there's no other code mentioned elsewhere. Scanning again, the rest is about sections amended, but no other agenda items. So the answer should be E-3.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-3
