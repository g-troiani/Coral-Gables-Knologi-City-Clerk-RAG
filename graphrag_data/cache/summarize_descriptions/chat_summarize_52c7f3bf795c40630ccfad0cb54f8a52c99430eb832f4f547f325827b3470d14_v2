This program aims to manage parking issues such as unauthorized parking on swales and to alleviate neighborhood traffic congestion. Vice Mayor Anderson has discussed the program as a practical solution to these concerns. The program features residential parking permits displayed on green poles with extruded signs, which are thoughtfully designed to blend harmoniously with the communityâ€™s aesthetic and minimize sign pollution. One specific application of the program includes managing parking near the Salvadore dog park, demonstrating its adaptability to various neighborhood contexts.
