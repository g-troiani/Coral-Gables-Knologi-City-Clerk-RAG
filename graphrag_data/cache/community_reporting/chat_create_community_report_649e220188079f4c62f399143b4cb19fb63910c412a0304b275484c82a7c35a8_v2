Major Transit Stops are defined by their location at metro stations or intersections of multiple high-frequency bus or trolley routes, specifically those included in the Better Bus Network. The Better Bus Network comprises key bus routes such as Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas, and Coral Way, all of which qualify as Major Transit Stops and thus influence the application of the Parking Reduction Policy. The City Commission plays a pivotal role in considering and granting parking reductions based on the criteria set forth in the policy.\",\n  \"rating\": 4.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderate due to the policy's influence on urban planning and transit-oriented development, which affects city infrastructure and commuter patterns but does not pose immediate high-risk threats.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Parking Reduction Policy under the Live Local Act enables targeted parking reductions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Parking Reduction Policy is a key regulatory framework that allows for reductions in parking requirements within a half-mile radius of Major Transit Stops. This policy is designed to encourage transit-oriented development by reducing the need for parking spaces in areas well-served by public transportation. The policy includes specific criteria such as accessible routes and property size considerations to ensure that reductions are applied appropriately and do not negatively impact accessibility or urban functionality.
