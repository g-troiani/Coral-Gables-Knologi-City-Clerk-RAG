This is a public hearing item.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Good morning/ afternoon,  sorry afternoon,  Jennifer Garcia,  Planning Official. So, staff have been requested by the Commission to give a presentation about Live Local Act and its impact on Coral Gables.  We' ll run through some excerpts of the Act,  highlighting different issues and how it impacts Coral Gables and I'll close with legislation that was just read into the record about parking reductions.  If I can have the PowerPoint,  please.  Thank you. So, the Live Local Act also known as Senate Bill No. 102,  became effective July 1st of last year 2023. And the intent is to address the states of portability housing crisis by preempting local zoning regulations.  It also allows access to over $800 million dollars of funding through various financial programs.  So, the city, according to Live Local Act must authorize development at least 40 percent of its residential units to be deemed affordable,  and that' s up to 120 percent of that adjusted median income or AMI, and in developments only allowed to be in our mixed- use districts.  So, we have three mixed- use districts,  MX1, MX2, and MX3, that it will be applicable to, and you can see that on the map here.  The map on the left side is our northern portion of the city, which chose MX1, along 8th Street;  MX3 more or less on Ponce de Leon Boulevard,  a mix of mixed- use districts in our CBD and downtown area, as well as on the map on the right side is our second half of the city and that' s showing mixed-use in our Design and Innovation District,  along U.S.-1, as well as the urban center down by the City of South Miami at Red Road and Sunset.  So affordable is defined by Chapter 420 of the Florida State Statutes to mean the monthly rents, including taxes,  insurance, and utilities cannot cost more than 30 percent of the local median adjusted income ( AMI). In that case it' s Miami-Dade County.  So,  it's not considered for a city where… is going to be through countywide and that' s according to the Florida State Statutes.  So,  what is affordable?  There is a resource at floridahousing. org that has these rent limits that we' ll be referring to. So, you can see from the snippet here,  that there' s different percentages of the base of the AMI, which\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a5d4fd7b711710aae35bf6d501cae4acb2e9dc9565ef9c3c6521155bc058835e_v2"}
