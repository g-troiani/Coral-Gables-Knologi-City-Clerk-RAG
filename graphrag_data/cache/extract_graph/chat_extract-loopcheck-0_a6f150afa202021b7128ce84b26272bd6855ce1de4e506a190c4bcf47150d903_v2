Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

So, its planting,  location,  and conditions,  and soils,  and all those things that go into whether or not they will survive.  So, I did see live oaks out in El Paso when I was there, so I don' t know if its really necessarily the heat level or the lack of a freeze,  I guess some research that someone would\n\nhave to do on whether or not they need a freeze,  but I know that that' s true with many other varieties of trees and why we can' t grow Sycamores down here and so forth.  It's not because it doesn' t get hot elsewhere.  It was 102 degrees in Chicago one year.  It's not the heat so much,  its does that tree require a freeze and where is it planted.  So, it was a brutal summer.  My kids wanted to go shopping.  Is it air-conditioned was the only question I kept asking them.  So,  yes,  looking forward to the trees getting planted.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  So, what I would like to see done is just have a conversation with Dr. Feely and report back to us on what recommendations he would have.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn: Absolutely. I'm familiar with Dr.  Feely' s research. Our arborist,  our senior arborist and I have looked into it. We' ve read his articles.\n\nMayor Lago:  You' ve already incorporated some of his guidance,  right.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Yes. So basically,  just in a nutshell,  I don' t want to take too much time, but this concern is due to climate change.  Any tropical tree species migrating up to different areas and as we have a heat change in temperature,  he was concerned live oaks might migrate further north,  because they are not a tropical species.  But in our tree succession planning and here' s our list,  and also,  we had zoning code changes this year,  it encourages more tree diversity and we' re following a lot more tree diversity and here' s the list if anyone' s interested, but you can see a big variety of different natives,  flowering trees with a few oaks,  because oaks are still very viable today.  They are the most sustainable tree.  Our senior arborist stands by them. They are so resilient in hurricanes.  You can see the longevity of them in urban areas. Look at Coral Way,  they' ve been here 80-100 years.  Today,  they are still viable and so,  the concept of what' s going to happen in the future because of unknown climate change is good research to be familiar with, there are so many different opinions on it. So that' s where we are.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I appreciate it.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Sure.\n\n=== END OF ITEM F-6 TRANSCRIPT ===\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, who requested a conversation with Dr. Feely and a report on his recommendations regarding tree planting and climate concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEELY<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Feely, a researcher whose work on tree species migration and climate change was referenced by Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn and whose recommendations Commissioner Fernandez requested to be reported back.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELL-LLEWELYN<|>PERSON<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn, who is familiar with Dr. Feely's research, has consulted with the senior arborist, and provided information on tree diversity, climate change impacts, and tree succession planning in Coral Gables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, who acknowledged that some of Dr. Feely's guidance has already been incorporated into city planning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREE_SUCCESSION_PLANNING<|>PROJECT<|>Tree succession planning project in Coral Gables that includes a list of diverse native and flowering trees, with a focus on sustainable and resilient species like live oaks, as described by Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZONING_CODE_CHANGES_2024<|>PROJECT<|>Zoning code changes implemented in 2024 that encourage more tree diversity in Coral Gables, referenced by Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn as part of the city's environmental planning efforts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>FEELY<|>Commissioner Fernandez requested a conversation with Dr. Feely and a report on his recommendations, indicating a direct request for expertise.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELL-LLEWELYN<|>FEELY<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn is familiar with Dr. Feely's research and has reviewed his articles with the senior arborist.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>FEELY<|>Mayor Lago acknowledged that some of Dr. Feely's guidance has already been incorporated into city planning.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELL-LLEWELYN<|>TREE_SUCCESSION_PLANNING<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn described the tree succession planning project and its focus on tree diversity and sustainability.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BELL-LLEWELYN<|>ZONING_CODE_CHANGES_2024<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn referenced the 2024 zoning code changes that encourage more tree diversity.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
