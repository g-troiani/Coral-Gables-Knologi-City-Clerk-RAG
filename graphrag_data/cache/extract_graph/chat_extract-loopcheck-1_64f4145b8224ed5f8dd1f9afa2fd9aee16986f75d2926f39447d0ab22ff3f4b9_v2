They weren' t on Coral Way, they weren' t at DeSoto Fountain,  but they were at places like the Douglas Entrance.  You can see the standard metal and then you can also see what I call this transit line fixture. You know, we had a wonderful trolley that went through here, and those lights are attached to the electric lines that the trolley went to. The fountains and all of the monuments and entrances that we have all had the same type of what we call luminaire.  So, you can see that the fixtures in there all match what was there. Everything was silver. Everything had a look so that when you came into Coral Gables you knew that you were in a special place.  Thank you. You can see the transit light after the war over here on Miracle Mile, and then how that Fink light is there at the Douglas Entrance.  The history of the lights is really interesting.  In the 1980s,  right now I had the opportunity to go through the city archives and dig out a bunch of things,  because you know,  we' ve been working on this for ever and ever and ever,  and in 1980,  the city and the Historic Preservation Board identified 21 different types of streetlights in our city. I'm going to show you in just a few minutes almost a dozen.  The City Commission received a report and then discussed,  and I can' t find an action item where they actually adopted it but sought to standardize the streetlights in 1980 and begin working diligently with not only the Historic Preservation Board,  and the Board of Architects and other advisors,  but with the Florida Power and Light Company and Public Works Department.  After a while, about a year, it was an Arcadian fixture, which you can see right here, was selected and it's actually in the catalog of this company and it's called a Coral Gables Light Fixture, and this is the one that' s been in use really since that time. So, they provided this to FPL, told FPL and FPL came back and said the following,  company owned fixtures will normally be mounted on poles of the company' s existing distribution system and serve from overhead wires on request by the customer, of the customer,  the company will provide special poles and underground wires that charges specified below. In other words, this is their rate base.  We all know that FPL has a rate base.  They\n\nhave to go to the Public Service Commission.  They have to take everything that everybody asks them for and then have it approved,  and what we' re asking for is to come back and take a look at that. In 1986 FPL purchased these lights and installed them for us. We don' t have the capability to do it. They first went in on Segovia.  They are still there.  They look great,  haven' t been taken out. And so, this is what we have. The light I'm showing you right now though isn' t on Segovia,  but it' s exactly like the one there. This is over by the Douglas Entrance,  and it was just installed;  and if you look at the ground plan, you' ll see that there' s a new base and there' s the markings out for the new wire. So, they put this in and yet, they are taking out poles exactly like this and putting in black poles which are really not appropriate and haven' t been here.  If you would please.  Thank you.  Being a guy that' s been involved in cities for over 45 years,  I have to have a map,  and so I went around town and the red lines that you see on the map that' s where the silver standard White Way Lights are. Now they are intermixed with some of the Denman Fink lights and I'm thrilled to have those back. That' s just the best thing. I've been advocating that for years.  And Mayor and all of you here on the Commission,  I really applaud your efforts for this. It's so unique and I hope that we take advantage of that and continue to use those lights in even more special places,  but the whole idea here about this is to say look, we have a lot of these things already.  Let' s not change them,  let' s re-enforce it. Let' s also look at and see what we can do to, if you would please go to the next one, to change these streetlights,  because these are the most common streetlights that we have in Coral Gables.  The wood pole that you can see.  The one mounted on a concrete pole or theâ€¦ concrete pole. Show the next one please. And then we have other streetlights.  And these other streetlights are generally with the exception of the one in the middle,  and that also happens there too,  are generally a private development,  but they are on city right-of-way.  Why doesn' t the city say hey, we' ve got a brand here, use our streetlights.  You get to put it in, you get to pay for it, but please use ours,  and you can use our great Denman Fink lights if you wish.  Go to the next one please.  We have the one in the middle is about four of them and they are over at the French Village on Hardee.  The one here,  let' s see,  on your right is all throughout the northeastern apartment district,  and they' ve been there since close to dirt, because I remember them there over 40 years ago.
