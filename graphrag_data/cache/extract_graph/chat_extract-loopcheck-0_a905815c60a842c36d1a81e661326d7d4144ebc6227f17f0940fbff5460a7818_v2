I think that' s something that as we continue to renovate our City parks and improve the City parks in other areas,  including Phillips Park,  hopefully beginning next year,  we will see some shift in that use,  but it is something that must be addressed. Because just seeing your pictures,  I've seen the cars parking in the swale every morning,  and I've seen the effect that it has on residences. Like Vice Mayor Anderson stated,  I myself have been a victim of people parking and blocking my driveway on a regular basis because of a business at the end of my block. So, I have seen that impact,  and in some cases,  we' ve tried to get the people to move and they just refused to do so.   We' ve had to call the police in order to get them out and remove them from blocking driveways.   What I would have liked to have seen prior to this is some sort of resolution between the school and the neighbors,  instead of having to get to this point where now we' re basically airing the neighborhood laundry here in the City Commission.   Between first and second reading,  like the Mayor said,  I think there needs to be a sit down and some sort of resolution between both sides on something that will work going forward.   If the plans are to expand,  I do have concerns because there is no parking there and that will be something that must be addressed. But I think the Mayor brought up a very good point of including the Manager in this conversation and the City Attorney,  because I think it' s also encumbered upon us in the City if we have made all these improvements on Salvadore Park,  that we are not creating more problems for the neighbors in the area and that we are part of finding a solution.   So, I think it' s something that we need to work together,  City,  the school,  and the neighbors on finding a solution that works for everybody.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner Menendez.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Thank you, Mayor.   Speaking of Salvadore Park,  I drove by the other evening,  and I noticed a great many cars parked,  I guess,  next to the dog park.   Is that --  have we\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nalways had folks parking --?   Because it' s not --  it' s dirt basically,  between the playground area and the dog park.  I just see there are parks there --  cars everywhere parked.   I don' t know if that' s officially a parking spot or…\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' re looking --  I've already talked to -- after the dog park we opened the dog park, I noticed that that was a mud area,  and I've already talked to Public Works about changing that into some type of rock, like a granite, so that it can be used as a parking area,  yet not turn it into asphalt.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Okay,  because it is pretty clear that people are looking for parking spots where there aren' t any.   And I don' t recall in the past seeing cars there.   I too have --  I feel the same way.   The project in and of itself,  I think it' s a wonderful project,  well presented,  well thought out for all the right reasons,  but the fact that the different parties haven' t come to a meeting of the minds taints the whole process. We should be here celebrating a wonderful project that everybody can embrace,  but unfortunately,  there are a lot of loose ends.   So, that' s not a positive, not only with this item,  but with any item that comes before the City Commission. We' ve had plenty of items that just seem to sometimes unravel because one string is loose,  they pull and everything comes apart.   So, let' s try to avoid that.  I have a couple questions for, I guess,  the City Attorney.   Is -- so, the number of students that are allowed,  let' s start there.   That' s written where in terms of…\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  In their prior approval,  and there' s a recorded covenant as well.  So --  and they' re not asking for an amendment to that or a change in connection…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And I understand.\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSuÆrez:  With this amendment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Exactly. And I'm not saying they are or that they will,  but to understand the legal ramifications of that agreement or that document,  what happens if a school does expand?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  They would have to come before you and request that. You would all review it and request approval of an amendment to their prior approvals.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And if we find out that they' ve added a hundred more students or 50 more students,  then what would the City have?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So, they have to -- and maybe the planner can come up, but I think annually they submit an affidavit.   Isn' t that…?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   City Planner,  Jennifer Garcia.   So,  they --  I believe they submit something every single year, every single school year to…\n\nMs. Russo:   I think it's done toward the middle of September.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:  ( INAUDIBLE)  every January.\n\nMs. Russo:   January.\n\nCity Planner\n\nGarc\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Mentioned as an example agenda item format; no direct reference in text but implied in discussion about agenda items and items before City Commission)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where various city matters including park renovations and parking issues were discussed)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, referenced as a speaker who stated concerns about parking and driveway blocking)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the City Commission meeting and facilitating discussion)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, participant in the meeting, raised concerns about parking near Salvadore Park and the dog park)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY MANAGER IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Iglesias, involved in addressing parking issues near the dog park and coordinating with Public Works)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY ATTORNEY SUÁREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Suárez, providing legal guidance regarding prior approvals, covenants, and amendments related to school expansions)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY PLANNER JENNIFER GARCIA<|>PERSON<|>City Planner Jennifer Garcia, explaining annual submission of affidavits by the school regarding student numbers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS.
