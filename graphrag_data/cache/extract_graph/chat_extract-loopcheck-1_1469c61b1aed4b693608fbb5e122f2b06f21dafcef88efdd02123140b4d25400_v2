I think live oaks;  he was talking about the two-degree temperature change would probably kill off most of our live oak trees.  So,  I just wanted to put that on everybody' s radar and maybe have the city have a conversation with Dr. Feely and make sure that if we are changing and doing a tree succession that we do take into account potential changes to temperature to make sure that five or ten years down the road if we do have an impact of a couple of years of two-degree or three-degree change to our temperature,  we don' t lose a lot of our tree canopy.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you respond,  could you give us a little bit of background in regard to the existing tree replacement program that we' ve had going on for the last,  I don' t know,  almost a decade.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Absolutely. Hello Commission, Mayor,  I'm Deena BellLlewelyn,  Greenspace Management from Public Works, for the record. Our current tree succession project we launch every year, we have a Commission- fed budget of $200,000 per year for that tree succession project every year.  Right now, there' s 2023 project is coming out of Procurement.  We intend to award it to the contractor,  hopefully within the next week or two to start replanting 111 total trees,  as part of this year' s project,  and as soon as we finish this one,  we roll right into next year where we already have hopefully 90 to 100 trees ready to plan.  We put this out to bid with contractors,  because the size of the project is large.  So, it buys about 100 trees a year on average.\n\nMayor Lago:  And if you go right now to, I was there last week,  if you go to our Public Works Department where the actual yard, you' ll get to see a lot of the oak trees that are basically ready to be transplanted from that office to the area where they are going to be relocated forever in the city. So, you can see all the trees are basically ready there for the contractor to take them to plant them somewhere in the neighborhoods.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Right. And in our Public Works yard we have about 40 oaks. We' re trying to green them up with more water before we plant them.  They dropped all their leaves,  and they are a little brown for our taste, so we' re waiting for them to green up.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  I used to do that by sinking them in six inches of water or more,  because they can tolerate about six weeks'  worth of being in standing water,  any of the ones that went into shock and then I would see the growth,  but right now they are dropping their leaves anyway.  So, a lot of yellowing there.  Where we have the most heat,  generally, is in our Central Business District.  I've seen some plantings that when they were put in, depending on where the location is, the ones that are more isolated with more asphalt around them and reflection are the ones of course that suffer the most and then some of the others of the same variety of tree have no problem making it. So, its planting,  location,  and conditions,  and soils,  and all those things that go into whether or not they will survive.  So, I did see live oaks out in El Paso when I was there, so I don' t know if its really necessarily the heat level or the lack of a freeze,  I guess some research that someone would\n\nhave to do on whether or not they need a freeze,  but I know that that' s true with many other varieties of trees and why we can' t grow Sycamores down here and so forth.  It's not because it doesn' t get hot elsewhere.  It was 102 degrees in Chicago one year.  It's not the heat so\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F-6<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda Item F-6, discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning the tree canopy replacement program, sponsored by Commissioner Ariel Fernandez.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_OF_CORAL_GABLES_CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MEETING<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, at the City Commission Chambers, 405 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, FL, where Agenda Item F-6 was discussed.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City Commission of Coral Gables, including Mayor Vince Lago, Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson, Commissioner Melissa Castro, Commissioner Ariel Fernandez, and Commissioner Kirk Menendez, responsible for city governance and decision-making.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_ATTORNEY_CRISTINA_SUAREZ<|>PERSON<|>Cristina Suárez, serving as City Attorney for the City of Coral Gables.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_PETER_IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>Peter Iglesias, serving as City Manager for the City of Coral Gables.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_CLERK_BILLY_URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>Billy Urquia, serving as City Clerk for the City of Coral Gables.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENSPACE_MANAGEMENT_DIRECTOR_DEENA_BELL-LLEWELYN<|>PERSON<|>Deena Bell-Llewelyn, Greenspace Management Director from Public Works for the City of Coral Gables, responsible for the tree succession project and related greenspace initiatives.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREE_SUCCESSION_PROJECT<|>PROJECT<|>Annual tree succession project managed by the City of Coral Gables Greenspace Management, funded by a Commission-fed budget of $200,000 per year, involving planting approximately 100 trees annually, including the 2023 project to replant 111 trees.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROTARY_CLUB_MEETING_NOVEMBER_2023<|>MEETING<|>Rotary Club meeting held in November 2023 where Dr. Feely from the University of Miami presented on potential changes to the tree canopy due to rising temperatures in South Florida.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR_FEELEY<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Feely from the University of Miami, who presented at the Rotary Club meeting about the impact of higher temperatures on the tree canopy in South Florida, including effects on oak trees and mahoganies.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC_WORKS_DEPARTMENT_YARD<|>PROJECT<|>Public Works Department yard in Coral Gables where oak trees are kept and prepared for transplantation as part of the tree succession project.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-6<|>CITY_OF_CORAL_GABLES_CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Agenda Item F-6 was discussed during the City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-6<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>Agenda Item F-6 was sponsored and discussed by members of the City Commission, including Commissioner Ariel Fernandez and Mayor Vince Lago.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-6<|>GREENSPACE_MANAGEMENT_DIRECTOR_DEENA_BELL-LLEWELYN<|>Deena Bell-Llewelyn provided detailed information and updates regarding the tree succession project during the discussion of Agenda Item F-6.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-6<|>TREE_SUCCESSION_PROJECT<|>Agenda Item F-6 concerns the ongoing tree succession project, including the 2023 planting of 111 trees and plans for future plantings.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-6<|>DR_FEELEY<|>Commissioner Fernandez referenced Dr. Feely's presentation at the Rotary Club meeting about the impact of temperature changes on tree canopy during the discussion of Agenda Item F-6.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DR_FEELEY<|>ROTARY_CLUB_MEETING_NOVEMBER_2023<|>Dr. Feely presented at the Rotary Club meeting in November 2023 on tree canopy impacts due to temperature changes.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREENSPACE_MANAGEMENT_DIRECTOR_DEENA_BELL-LLEWELYN<|>TREE_SUCCESSION_PROJECT<|>Deena Bell-Llewelyn manages and oversees the annual tree succession project funded by the City Commission.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREE_SUCCESSION_PROJECT<|>PUBLIC_WORKS_DEPARTMENT_YARD<|>The tree succession project involves transplanting trees, including about 40 oak trees currently held at the Public Works Department yard for preparation and planting.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>CITY_ATTORNEY_CRISTINA_SUAREZ<|>Cristina Suárez serves as City Attorney for the City Commission.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>CITY_MANAGER_PETER_IGLESIAS<|>Peter Iglesias serves as City Manager for the City Commission.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>CITY_CLERK_BILLY_URQUIA<|>Billy Urquia serves as City Clerk for the City Commission.<|>10)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
