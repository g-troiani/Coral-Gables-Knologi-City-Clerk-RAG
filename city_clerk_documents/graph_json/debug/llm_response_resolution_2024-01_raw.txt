Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the given resolution document. The instructions are strict: only return the code in the specified format, nothing else. 

First, I'll read through the entire document carefully. The document starts with the city name and resolution number. Then it's about appointing Judith Alexander to the Senior Citizens Advisory Board. The body of the resolution has sections 1 through 3, then mentions the passage date and voting details.

Looking for keywords like "Agenda Item" since that's what we're after. Scanning the end of the document, I see "AgendaItem: D-1)" right before the names of the Mayor and others. That looks like the code. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. The beginning doesn't have it. The sections talk about the appointment but no agenda item. The key line is at the bottom. The code here is D-1. 

The format requires just the letters and numbers, so "D-1" fits. I should check if there are any other possible codes, but this seems to be the only one. No other references. So the answer is D-1.
