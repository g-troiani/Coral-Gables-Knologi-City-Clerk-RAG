This amendment creates Section 5-314, titled \"Window and Hurricane Shutters,\" which regulates the closure of window and hurricane shutters. The ordinance also amends Chapter 1-General Provisions, Section 1-7, entitled \"Penalties,\" to establish penalties for the closure of window and hurricane shutters outside of the designated hurricane season. The ordinance includes standard provisions such as a severability clause, repealer provision, codification, and an effective date.\n\nThe ordinance was sponsored by Commissioner Ariel Fernandez and presented by Assistant City Attorney Gus Ceballos during the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024. The primary purpose of the amendment is to ensure that window and hurricane shutters are only closed during the hurricane season, thereby maintaining the aesthetic and safety standards of the community during other times of the year.\n\nAdditionally, Agenda Item E-7 also involves amendments to Article 10, \"Parking and Access,\" of the Zoning Code, specifically considering the reduction of parking requirements for affordable housing located near major transit stops. This aspect of the ordinance aims to support affordable housing initiatives by easing parking regulations in transit-accessible areas.\n\nOverall, Agenda Item E-7 comprehensively addresses both the regulation of hurricane shutter usage and parking requirements related to affordable housing, reflecting the City Commissionâ€™s efforts to balance community safety, urban aesthetics, and housing accessibility.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840821, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 315, "prompt_tokens": 790, "total_tokens": 1105, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
