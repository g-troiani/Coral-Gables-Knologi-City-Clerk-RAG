It includes detailed provisions on various aspects such as use, density, height, floor area ratio (FAR), open space, and parking requirements. A notable component of the code is Article 11, \"Signs,\" specifically Section 11-107, which has been amended by Agenda Item E-8 to address signage regulations.\n\nThe zoning code serves as the primary reference for city planning and development decisions, including evaluations conducted by city officials such as Planning Official Garcia. According to Garcia, certain amendments to the code, for example related to bus stops, may not be necessary if those stops are eliminated, as the ordinance criteria remain unchanged.\n\nWhile the zoning code generally governs land use and development activities, it does not impose binding restrictions on the City of Coral Gables regarding the construction, modification, or operation of certain city facilities, which are explicitly enumerated within the code. Additionally, some zoning regulations are preempted by state legislation, notably the Live Local Act, which affects developments that comply with the Actâ€™s provisions.\n\nThe City also applies the zoning code in the context of Government Settlements, ensuring that land use approvals and compliance are consistent with legal agreements and regulatory requirements. Overall, the Coral Gables Zoning Code functions as a vital tool for managing urban growth, maintaining orderly development, and balancing regulatory oversight with state-level mandates and city operational needs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762928, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 301, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 613, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
