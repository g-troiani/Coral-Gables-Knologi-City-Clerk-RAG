I was not exactly thrilled by our decorations on Miracle Mile this year.  I think we can do better.  I know that we did approve a budget for it. I know that there were issues with the timing and with storms and the lighting,  but I would like to see going forward and I did receive some complaints from residents about the decorations on Miracle Mile.  I would like to see this central avenue in our city be highlighted which ends at the Menorah that the Mayor purchased,  our Santa which is over 60 years old, and the park that we have every year and our Christmas Tree. I think it's important that Miracle Mile be highlighted going forward.  So that' s what I would like to see going forward,  it's just an improvement.  I know that we did in the past rely on the BID for some of this as well, but I think I would like to see an improvement.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago: Mr. Manager,  if I may. Belkys, you and I have talked on multiple occasions in regard to we received some emails and some kudos from business owners and people who have visited in regard to how much better the holiday decorations looked this year in comparison to past years, correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago: Just to give a little bit of background,  because I know that two of the Commissioners were not here when this happened.  When the BID was basically removed from the picture,  we were in the process of working with them to come to an agreement and we had to scramble to pick up the pieces.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  We had two weeks to put it together.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two weeks.  Your team did a wonderful job,  along with the Manager.  This was basically like a dry run the first year. In regard to the Santa Clause,  you want to replace the Santa Clause.  I probably received five emails from people saying that the Santa Clause is historic and don' t touch my Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Who wants to replace it?\n\nMayor Lago:  I don' t know. I'm just telling you. You said something about the 60-year-old Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, I said leading up to it. We should make sure that the avenue leading to all of our historic decorations and the Menorah,  it needs to measure up, because…\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I thought you wanted to replace the Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Not at all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I just love him.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There was a request to render it historic and to that point,  I think we need to do something to protect it, because it' s kind of just out in the open on a corner.  We need to make sure there' s something in front of it protecting it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Besides that. How much did we spend on the park in the last three years?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  On the park or on Miracle Mile?\n\nMayor Lago:  No, no. Miracle Mile is another thing. On the park.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I don' t know.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  I know it was a big investment.  Mr. Manager,  we hadn' t changed the decorations in decades,  correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  We changed it about three years ago and we are up on the new contract now.\n\nMayor Lago:  But what was the number,  it was massive.  We spent a lot of money.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  I think it was 250, 300, something like that…\n\nMayor Lago: We spent a lot of money on the park and obviously,  we' ve also spent,  how much did we spend on Miracle Mile so far?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Miracle Mile and Giralda for the holiday decorations, 147,000 and my budget was $150,000.\n\nMayor Lago:  Did we buy these ornaments,  or these were just rented?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez: There' s only a certain portion which was bought. Basically,  they were hand made for us, so the ornaments that are hanging from the trees and the ones that are on the median,  the stars that are on the median,  that is the only thing that we will continue with for the next three years.  So, two more years we' ve got of that. And then everything else,  so about $ 64,000, we have the ability to go out and we are going to go out to get bids for\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
