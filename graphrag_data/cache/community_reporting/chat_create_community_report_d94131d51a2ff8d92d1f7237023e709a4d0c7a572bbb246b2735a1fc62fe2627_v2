The Notice Requiring Conversion of Utility Service Facilities serves as the initial formal warning to property owners, informing them of the requirement to convert within 30 days or face city-initiated conversion and liens for costs. This notice is embedded within the broader Notice of Property Owner's Failure to Convert Facilities, which is sent by the city manager when conversion has not been completed, demanding compliance within 60 days.

Initially, notices are sent via registered mail. If this method fails, a law enforcement officer is authorized to serve the notice physically to occupants or agents of the property owner.
