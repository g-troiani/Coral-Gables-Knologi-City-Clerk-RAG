The key entity, the Notice of Public Hearing, serves as the primary formal announcement mechanism and is supported by two supplementary notification methods: the Courtesy Notice and Property Posting. The Notice of Public Hearing ensures transparency and public engagement by disseminating information through multiple channels, including property postings and newspaper publications.

This entity ensures compliance with Article 15 of the applicable regulations by mandating dissemination through multiple channels, such as posting on the affected properties and publication in a newspaper of general circulation. The notice must be published at least ten days prior to the hearing, with a minimum of 15 days' advance notice in the newspaper, ensuring ample time for public awareness and participation.
