The Public Hearing is closely linked to three notification mechanisms: Public Hearing Notice, Courtesy Notice, and Property Posting Sign.

It holds the highest degree of connectivity (degree 4) among the entities, indicating its central role. This entity ensures that decisions affecting city infrastructure undergo public scrutiny and regulatory oversight, which is critical for maintaining lawful governance and community involvement.

The notice serves as a critical transparency mechanism, enabling community members to be aware of and potentially participate in the decision-making process.
