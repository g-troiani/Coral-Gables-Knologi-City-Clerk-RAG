This amendment specifically targets Article 11, \"Signs,\" Section 11-107, titled \"Real Estate, For Sale, Lease or Rental of Property or Buildings.\" The ordinance seeks to standardize and apply the same regulations to signs related to the sale, lease, or rental of property or buildings across all use districts within the city. The amendment includes a severability clause, a repealer provision, codification, and an effective date, ensuring the legal robustness and clarity of the changes.\n\nSecondly, Agenda Item E-8 also refers to a resolution identified as document number 23-6707, which approves the receipt and use of Transfer of Development Rights (TDRs) pursuant to Article 14, Section 14-204.6 of the Zoning Code. This resolution authorizes the application of TDRs for a Mixed-Use project known as \"Ponce Park Residences.\" The project is located on property legally described as Lots 8 through 21, less the West half of Lot 8, Block 29, Crafts Section, including part of the 20-foot platted alley east of Lots 11 and 19 in Block 29. The addresses involved include 3000 Ponce de Leon Blvd, 216 & 224 Catalonia, 203 University Dr, and 225 Malaga in Coral Gables, Florida. The resolution includes necessary conditions for approval, a repealer provision, a severability clause, and an effective date. This action was recommended for approval by the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) on December 13, 2023, with a vote of 4-2.\n\nTogether, these components of Agenda Item E-8 reflect the City Commission’s efforts to update zoning regulations related to signage for real estate transactions citywide and to facilitate the development of a significant mixed-use project through the strategic use of Transfer of Development Rights. Both measures include standard legal provisions to ensure enforceability and clarity, and they were formally presented and considered during the City Commission meeting held at the City Commission Chambers, 405 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, FL.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844107, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 501, "prompt_tokens": 900, "total_tokens": 1401, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
