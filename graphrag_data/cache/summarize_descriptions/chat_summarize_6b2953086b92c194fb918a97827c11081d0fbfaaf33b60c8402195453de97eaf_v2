This submission typically includes comprehensive documentation, such as evidence of ownership, use statements, detailed plans, certifications, and ecological studies, to support the proposal. The application must be accompanied by a required fee and is subject to an initial review for completeness and compliance with relevant regulations. Following this, the application undergoes further processing and evaluation by various city departments and committees to ensure all standards and requirements are met. Additionally, an application may be rejected if a similar request has been considered within the past year, preventing repetitive or redundant submissions.
