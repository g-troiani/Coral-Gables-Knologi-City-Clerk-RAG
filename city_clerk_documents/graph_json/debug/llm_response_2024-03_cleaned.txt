Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user said it could be anywhere, so I have to check every page. Let me start skimming through the text.

Looking at the first part, there's the ordinance number and some sections being amended. The WHEREAS clauses and the sections listed don't have any agenda item mentions. Then in the body, after the sections, there's a part where it says "AgendaItem: E-3)" on what looks like page 2. Wait, let me check again. 

Looking at the end of the document, towards the bottom of the text, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-3)" right before some deletions and page numbers. Also, in the same area, the same code is mentioned again. The format matches the examples given, like "Agenda Item: E-3". The user wants the exact code as written, so even if there's a typo like missing space, but here it's written as "AgendaItem: E-3)" with a hyphen. 

I should check all instances. Scanning through again, I don't see any other codes like H-3 or others. The only one that fits is E-3. The example in the user's message shows that even if there's a period or dash, we take it as is. So the correct code here is E-3.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-3
