So, what we need to do is work together so that we just continue to advance quality of life in the neighborhood.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Agreed.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think Ms. Russo had a comment from a resident that you want to maybe deliver.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, that was Ed Diaz and I told him, he came up with an idea and I said let' s save that for when we all meet.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just wanted to make sure…\n\nMs. Russo:   Together.\n\nMayor Lago:   We put your idea on the record and please.\n\nMs. Russo:   He' s the chief operating officer, so he deals a lot with the parents and asking them not to park on swales ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   We welcome all ideas between first and second.   So, I need a motion,  if I may.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I'll move it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Second.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes. Commissioner Castro:   Yes. Commissioner Fernandez:   Yes.

Do you know when this is coming back?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So, it'd be, I think, up to the applicant when they' re ready to come back, as long as we have time to provide mail notice.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think we need to work on a few things before bringing it back.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  I think one meeting is going to be a little bit too quick.\n\nMs. Russo:   Right, I think --  I was going to say,  I think we should make it for the second meeting in February…\n\nMayor Lago:   Perfectly\n\nfine.\n\nMs. Russo:   To give us enough time…\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think so.\n\nMs. Russo:   With all our different schedules.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think that would be --  I think second meeting in February is right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Because I think that we can…\n\nMs. Russo:   Right, second meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think we can potentially resolve this, find middle ground with those signs that the Vice Mayor mentioned could be really --  could really be an opportunity to really resolve it.   And any --  and again,  now' s the time to address other issues that are both beneficial for the school and for yourself.   And maybe the City can do better in that area.   Maybe we can be a better partner in one form or another.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   If we go the route of the signs,  I'll tell you right now, the signs --  and the reason I smile is because the signs are being used with tape lines to hold barricades that are not supposed to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:   And that' s what we' re going to -- and that' s what we' re going to talk about.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   And they' re not being enforced.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: That' s why I said to meet with the Landscape Department. They' re fabulous.   We have a nice swale package.\n\nMs. Russo:   And maybe someone from Parks and Rec could also be at the meeting…\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Good idea.\n\nMs. Russo:   Since…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nMs. Russo:   Along with the City Manager and the City Attorney.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Manager will make sure that his team is there.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Well, I think we cannot leave Salvadore issue --  park issue out, so I expect them to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.  So, we' ll --  then we' ll be hearing you from the end of February,  correct?\n\nMs. Russo:   The end of February,  yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   That gives enough time to have meetings and everything like that.\n\nMs. Russo:   Perfect.\n\nMayor Lago: Alright,  we' re going to take a five-minute break so everybody can go to the bathroom.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   And then we' ll be back for E-8.
