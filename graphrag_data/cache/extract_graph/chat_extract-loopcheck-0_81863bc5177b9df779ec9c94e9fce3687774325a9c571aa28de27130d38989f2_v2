So, go --  let it go on the record,  okay…\n\nMs. Tuyos:   That' s what they' re doing.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   That we do not want this continued expansion of single- family zoning and singlefamily homes,  okay, being built into future classroom space.\n\nMayor Lago:   I want to address one point before we hear from Ms. Russo,  okay.   So,  we can approve today,  moving on to second reading,  but one of the things that I would want is for there to be a real discussion between you and the school' s representative,  Russo,  and that the Manager' s team be engaged on that front.  Because there has to be -- I will not approve this on second reading if we don' t have a solution to, at a minimum --  because we' re not going to find a parking solution today,  okay,  and we' re not going to find it in the next five years. You know,  we have,  at a minimum,  we have to find something so that your quality of life is not impacted,  okay?  I haven' t been on the ground to see the, you know,  drop-off and pickup.   I've done it in other schools.   I know my colleagues have also.   So,  this is something that maybe we should see firsthand what we' re having. And I've done it where we don' t even -we don' t announce that we' re going because I want to see it when it's…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Really happening not where…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Let' s do it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Not when parents have been notified.  But I think that what we need to do is -- what we need to do is we need to have a conversation between first and second reading,  maybe the City Attorney can also join the conversation to find a solution to address what the Planning and Zoning Board and what your requests are.  There has to be common ground.   Ms. Russo?\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we did that by the way.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know, I know, but let me hear from Ms. Russo.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' ve reached out several times.\n\nMayor Lago:   And I want my colleagues to give me input and give me advice on what they would like to see.\n\nMs. Russo:   So, I'd like to rebut a couple of the statements.   So, with use of the swale,  I'm going to submit some photos that were taken not only of the neighbor' s home,  but of the church house across the street.   And Reverend Conroy will come address the use of that property.   And there are people parked on the swale of the church property that are cars that visit the home across the street. So, the use of the swale is being used as, you know, a public right-of-way for parking.   So, I just want to submit these pictures because it' s not just happening on their side of the street. It' s happening on the church property and people that use his home.   And some of these are taken at six in the morning,  so they' re not taken,  you know, when drop-off.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   You can put…\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSuÆrez:  Just make sure the Clerk has them,  please.\n\nMayor Lago:   Give them to the Clerk.\n\nMs. Russo:   And so I can let you know that I've been representing the school since 2000, I believe it was 2000 when I was first hired in 2001 through 3 when we did the master site plan.  And I can tell you that the that the master site plan did involve a new building.   The church,  as you know, owns a home in which Reverend Conroy lives.  They also own a home on Coral Way.  They have visiting clergy,  and all of this was addressed in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants.   We are here precisely because one of the conditions from the restrictive covenants was that if any building were to be demolished,  that it would have to go through the public hearing process and be approved\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nand go --  and you know,  be approved by the Board of Architects and be approved. Because a church owns a property doesn' t make it part of the school.  But for that, I'm going to ask Reverend Conroy to just slip in the rebuttal the response to that.\n\nMs. Conroy:   Still Mary Beth Conroy,  still confused about swales.   The St. Philip' s has bought a series of homes throughout the years,  long before my arrival in 2016.   The home at 1100 Coral Way became available and we purchased it for a residence for our head of school.   We rented it for two years before the head of school moved in.  We had a head of school who lived there for two years.   And then since that time, we have housed clergy there.  It is not used for classroom.   It is not used for children.   It is not authorized for use for children.   And we have no intention of growing the number of children at our school.
