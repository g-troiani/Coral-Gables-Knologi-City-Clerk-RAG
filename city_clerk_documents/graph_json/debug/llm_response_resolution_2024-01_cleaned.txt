Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the given resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by reading through the document text provided. The document is titled "RESOLUTION NO. 2024-01" and it's about appointing Judith Alexander to the Senior Citizens Advisory Board. The main sections here are the resolution's sections 1, 2, 3, and the passage details.

Looking at the end of the document, after the vote information, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: D-1)". The phrase "AgendaItem" is followed by a colon and then "D-1". The parentheses might be part of the formatting here, but the code itself is likely "D-1". 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Let me scan the entire text again. The beginning mentions the resolution number and the appointment, but no agenda item there. The sections of the resolution don't mention it either. The key line is at the very end before the signatures and other details. 

The example responses given by the user include codes like E-2 or F-10, so the format is a letter followed by a hyphen and a number. Here, "D-1" fits that pattern. The word "AgendaItem" is written as one word in the document, but that's probably just a typo or formatting issue. The important part is the code following it. 

I should check if there's any other possible code. The document has "Unanimous VoiceVote" and then the AgendaItem line. No other codes are present. The examples also mention that if not found, return NOT_FOUND, but here it's clearly there. 

So the correct code is D-1. The user wants only the code in the exact format AGENDA_ITEM: [code], so the answer should be AGENDA_ITEM: D-1. No explanations needed, just that line.


AGENDA_ITEM: D-1
