The program categorizes parcels into three size groups: less than 15,000 square feet, between 15,000 and 30,000 square feet, and greater than 30,000 square feet. Smaller parcels, those under 15,000 square feet, are eligible for larger parking reductions, while larger parcels, particularly those exceeding 30,000 square feet, qualify for smaller reductions.
