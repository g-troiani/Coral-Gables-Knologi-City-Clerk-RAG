Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the given resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by reading through the document text carefully. The document is titled "RESOLUTION NO. 2024-01" and it's about appointing Judith Alexander to the Senior Citizens Advisory Board. The main sections talk about the appointment details and the effective date.

Looking at the end of the document, after the sections, there's a part that says "AgendaItem: D-1)". That looks promising. The phrase "Agenda Item" is followed by "D-1" in parentheses. The format matches the examples given, like E-2 or F-10. The code here is D-1. 

I need to make sure there aren't any other mentions elsewhere. Let me scan again. The beginning of the document doesn't mention an agenda item. The sections 1, 2, 3 don't refer to it. The key part is at the end right before the names and titles. The line "AgendaItem: D-1)" is the only instance. 

The user specified to return ONLY the code, so I should ignore everything else. The example responses show that even if there's a parenthesis, just the code is needed. So the correct answer here is D-1. 

No other codes are present. The user also mentioned if none found, return NOT_FOUND, but here it's clearly there. So the answer is AGENDA_ITEM: D-1.
