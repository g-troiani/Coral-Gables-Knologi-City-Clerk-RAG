The proposed highway aims to reduce commute times by six or seven minutes; however, the resolution challenges the value and impact of this development. Instead of supporting the highway, the resolution advocates for redirecting investment toward rail infrastructure and other transit improvements. The cities involved emphasize the importance of reducing car dependency and promoting more sustainable transportation alternatives.
