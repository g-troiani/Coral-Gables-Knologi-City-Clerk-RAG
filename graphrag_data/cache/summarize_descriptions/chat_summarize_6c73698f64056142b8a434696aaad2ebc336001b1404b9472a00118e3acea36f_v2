It features a variety of recreational amenities, including playground equipment, tennis courts with a designated pickleball court, a dog park area, and a parking lot. The park is a popular local gathering spot and is heavily used, particularly during school drop-off and pick-up times, which has made it a focal point in discussions about parking, traffic, and neighborhood impact. The Toyos family and other community members have referenced Salvadore Park as a source of parking and traffic challenges during these busy periods. In response, the City of Coral Gables and involved parties have made improvements and are actively addressing parking concerns to mitigate the impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Overall, Salvadore Park serves as an important recreational and community space while also being central to ongoing efforts to balance neighborhood livability with park usage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762931, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
