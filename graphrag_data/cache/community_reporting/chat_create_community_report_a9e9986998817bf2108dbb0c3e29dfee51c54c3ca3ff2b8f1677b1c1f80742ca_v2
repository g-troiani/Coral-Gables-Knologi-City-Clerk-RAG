These criteria apply when the installations are located within utility easements, do not interfere with services or property use, and do not exceed two facilities per property unless exceptions are granted. This framework streamlines the approval process for certain installations, reducing the need for more extensive review procedures and potentially accelerating infrastructure deployment.

This authority introduces a discretionary oversight mechanism that ensures installations exceeding standard limits are carefully evaluated. The role of the City Manager or Designee is pivotal in maintaining regulatory compliance and addressing unique circumstances that may arise during undergrounding projects.

Specifically, the city manager or designee is authorized to reject or grant exceptions to the placement of multiple above ground facilities on a property, as stipulated by the criteria. This relationship ensures that while administrative review can expedite approvals under standard conditions, there remains a check-and-balance system for cases requiring additional scrutiny.

This limit is designed to minimize visual clutter, reduce interference with property use, and maintain service integrity.
