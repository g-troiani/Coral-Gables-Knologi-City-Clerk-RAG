The Board is also referenced in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants as the authoritative body responsible for approving building demolitions, particularly those related to school and church properties, underscoring its influence in maintaining the integrity of such community institutions.\n\nIn recent projects, the Board of Architects has demonstrated thorough review procedures. For instance, it approved the proposed preschool building design after multiple evaluations, including Design Review Committee (DRC) meetings held in April and August, as well as neighborhood consultations. This reflects the Board’s commitment to incorporating community input and ensuring design quality.\n\nAdditionally, the Board reviewed and approved a new school building design following two meetings. During this process, it required the inclusion of windows on the eastern side of the building for aesthetic reasons.
