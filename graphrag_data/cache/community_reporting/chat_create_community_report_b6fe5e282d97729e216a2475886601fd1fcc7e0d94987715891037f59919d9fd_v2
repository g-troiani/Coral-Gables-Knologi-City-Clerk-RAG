The ordinance seeks to limit the size and quantity of commercial signage, which has raised concerns among small businesses and tenants who rely heavily on physical signage for marketing.

Specifically, it proposes reducing commercial real estate signage to postcard size, which represents a significant reduction in allowable sign dimensions.

The ordinance reflects a governmental attempt to balance signage control with economic considerations within Coral Gables, but it has raised concerns about its potential negative impact on business marketing and visibility [Data: Entities (581, 1321, 1331); Relationships (2099, 2102, 2103)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Commercial real estate signs are vital marketing tools for small businesses and tenants\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Commercial real estate signs hold significant importance for business owners, especially small businesses and tenants who rely on these signs to market available commercial spaces and attract customers.
