precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nEntity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION\nText: \"Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed. This is Ordinance 2024-01.\"\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, which is the same as Ordinance 2024-01 and amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, also known as agenda item E-1, which amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same as<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Real Data-\nEntity types: agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project\nText: approval of the trustees of the internal improvement fund,  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and such other state and federal agencies concerned, and subject further to receipt of written request for extension of time by the city public works department prior to the original expiration date. The construction permit may be issued to a certified contractor provided:( 1)Construction plans and specifications are submitted which have been prepared to comply with the city public works standards.(2)The permit fee established by section 109-44 for construction work has been paid.(3)A performance bond is posted in an amount determined by the director of public works department to be essential to protect the interests of the public and of landowners in the vicinity of the work; provided however, that the minimum amount of such bond shall be $1,000.00 or 25 percent of the estimated cost of the work, whichever is lesser, and the maximum amount of such bond shall be 100 percent of the estimated cost of the work,  the bond being to guarantee compliance with terms of the permit and to be in force for at least six months after the approved completion date of the work.(4)Certification is provided by a registered engineer that he/she has been retained to provide engineering supervision throughout the construction period.\n\nf)Exceptions.  Those requirements of subsection ( c) of this section pertaining to a public hearing and approval by the city commission shall not apply to installation of mooring piles;  construction of docks adjacent to residential lots if the proposed mooring piles and docks are to be located in accordance with the city zoning code;  nor to repair or restoration of docks ( limited to original dimension only) for which state construction permits have been issued.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c1a948b86e452a8a0c50334e43233c5a640cbc9961f7109090ef7ed2c82df34a_v2"}
