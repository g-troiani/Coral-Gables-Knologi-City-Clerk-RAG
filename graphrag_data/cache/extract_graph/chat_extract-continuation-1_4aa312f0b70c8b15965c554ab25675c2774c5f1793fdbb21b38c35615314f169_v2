So, in summary,  the preemption is for the use,  the density,  and the height.  The use is for mixed- use districts.  I just went through the map of where those districts are in our urban areas, analyzed citywide and the height is whatever is allowed within one mile of that proposed property.  So,  the legislation before you today is what the Live Local Act is requiring the city to consider and that is a parking reduction within a half-a-mile of the development and the city can define what major transit stop means.  So, the legislation before you is to find major transit stop as a metro station or the intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with frequencies of service intervals of 15 minutes or less,  during morning and afternoon peak commute periods. So, taking a look at the better bus network, there have been some improvements to our bus system,  and so this would apply to Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas,  and Coral Way. Those will meet the kind of high frequency bus routes.  This is the map showing half-a-mile\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nfrom those intersecting points and also including the Metrorail stops. You can see it's mostly along our urban areas and then close to the City of South Miami.  So,  the criteria to request a parking reduction from the Commission would be half-a-mile from the major transit stop. It would have to be an accessible route from one quarter mile of that property of the development and a major transit stop. The Commission would consider any impact that parking reductions may have on a neighborhood and making sure its compatible with the surrounding area and the parking reductions are based on the size of the property.  So, a greater,  larger property would have less reduction and a larger reduction would be for the smaller properties and that would be to discourage larger,  taller buildings that may be out of character with the surrounding area.  And the Commission can also grant any rate of parking reductions that' s less than 6,000 square feet.  And that' s all I have.  So, staff is here, legal is here to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have one question on accessible route.  Let' s say that accessibility is defined as ADA compliant accessibility.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, I think we have, and I can bring it right now that the ordinance had,  sidewalks,  ramps,  crosswalks,  any way that' s easily to get to need proposed development to the major transit stop.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Okay.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I only have a question I brought up at agenda review.  You mentioned trolley stops and bus stops as triggering the need for this legislation or compatibility and I think in the discussion recently the county took away one of our, several bus stops or bus routes that we normally have.  So,  we' ll be passing legislation connected to particular bus stops when bus stops now, we know come and go, but once we approve this reduction in parking, even if those bus stops disappear down the road,  we still have the impact of today' s legislation.  I know we' re bound or required to do it, but its sort of not well thought out in Tallahassee,  but maybe that' s the norm these days.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  That' s the consideration the Commission makes if there' s a proposed development that once a reduction of parking maybe there' s a line that you think is not used that often,  maybe the concern that the county may remove it in the future, that' s up to your discretion.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  Right.  In each instance it will come to you all to consider and approve if that' s the will of the Commission to the parking reduction based on a consideration of the impact of the development on parking and the character of each particular neighborhood.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  And I just want to clarify that the ordinance doesn' t tie a consideration to a specific bus stop,  but it just defines a criteria to determine what a mass transit stop is, and so, if a bus stop is eliminated,  for example,  it wouldn' t require an amendment to the ordinance or to the zoning code, that criteria remain static.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that feedback.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you for the presentation.  You gave a good explanation of what we' re facing with Live Local. Any comments from the public.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Yes sir. We have a member of the public on Zoom who would like to speak is Aky Fernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:  The floor is yours. Good afternoon.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes sir.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Okay. Good afternoon,  everyone,  Aky Fernandez,  1542 Mendavia.  I'm a resident of the city lifelong.  Also, an architect and a builder.  Happy with this proposed legislation.  I think it' s a step in the right direction.  The only thing that I will say after sort of reading through it, you know frankly,  the reductions that are being proposed while I think they are well-intentioned,  I actually don' t think it' s going to go a significant way in terms of making the final product more affordable.  To be frank,  they need to be more generous,  the parking reductions,  if we' re actually going to see some of this inventory get built. I'll give you an example.  I have a project that I'm working on now,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIVE_LOCAL_ACT<|>ORDINANCE<|>The Live Local Act ordinance requires the City of Coral Gables to consider parking reductions within a half-mile of a development near major transit stops, defining major transit stops as metro stations or intersections of two or more major bus or trolley routes with service intervals of 15 minutes or less during peak commute periods.
