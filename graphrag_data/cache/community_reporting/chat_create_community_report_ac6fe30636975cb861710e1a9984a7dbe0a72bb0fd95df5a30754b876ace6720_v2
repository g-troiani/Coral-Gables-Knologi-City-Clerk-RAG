These changes reflect a strategic approach to urban planning that integrates ecological considerations into zoning regulations. By mandating or incentivizing tree diversity, the zoning code changes seek to foster a more resilient and sustainable urban canopy, which can improve air quality, reduce urban heat island effects, and support biodiversity.

It involves promoting a variety of native and flowering tree species to enhance sustainability and ecological resilience. Diverse tree populations are less susceptible to pests, diseases, and climate stressors, making this goal critical for long-term urban forest health.
