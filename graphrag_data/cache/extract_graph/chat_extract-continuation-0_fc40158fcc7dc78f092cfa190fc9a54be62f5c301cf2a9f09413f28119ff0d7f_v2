Because a church owns a property doesn' t make it part of the school.  But for that, I'm going to ask Reverend Conroy to just slip in the rebuttal the response to that.\n\nMs. Conroy:   Still Mary Beth Conroy,  still confused about swales.   The St. Philip' s has bought a series of homes throughout the years,  long before my arrival in 2016.   The home at 1100 Coral Way became available and we purchased it for a residence for our head of school.   We rented it for two years before the head of school moved in.  We had a head of school who lived there for two years.   And then since that time, we have housed clergy there.  It is not used for classroom.   It is not used for children.   It is not authorized for use for children.   And we have no intention of growing the number of children at our school.   What we want is better space,  but that house has never,  ever been used as a meeting place for children or teaching or anything.   We have a visiting bishop who comes for a month or two at a time.  We have --  that' s really all we' ve used it for is a residence.   So, it sits there empty a good part of the time, and occasionally,  we have someone stay there.   That' s it.   It' s a residence.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Do you have anything else, Ms. Russo?\n\nMs. Russo:   Excuse me?\n\nMayor Lago:   Do you have anything else you' d like to say?\n\nMs.  Russo: Yes,  I would just like to say that,  once again,  I think this is a community, a neighborhood issue.   It' s not an issue that should lay solely on the shoulders of St. Philip' s.   I'm aware of the swale package.   In fact, one of the neighbors --  we did have a neighborhood meeting, which the Toyos did not attend,  but the neighbor,  Dr. Forachi ( phonetic)  and the Lopez Cotardi phonetic),  we talked about the ability to landscape your swale since there has been so much use of a public swale.   I happen to live on Country Club Prado,  so I'm well aware how people use swale all the time to enjoy the city park.   And if I were to be so inclined to keep people from parking there,  I could avail myself of this. Deena Bell Llewellyn has done a great job of recommending native plant material and other materials,  you know,  shrubs and up to a certain height, et cetera, and doing this without having to pay for a permit and facilitating the hand drawing of it, et cetera.   And I shared that information with the neighbor who attended the meeting.   So, once again,  I ask you for approval of the building.  We understand the neighborhood dilemma,  but I ask you that we join as neighbors to try to figure out the problem and not lay it solely at the feet of a nonprofit that is not increasing students,  okay?   Because if in fact there were an increase in students,  I would be saying,  yeah,  we' re going to have a bigger impact.   I think we should do something,  but we' re not.   And I know the school complies with the affidavit as do the other schools with respect to the student cap.   So, you know, we do not want to enlarge the school.   We want to keep it a very small neighborhood school.   And again,  it's been there for 70 some years.\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   Thank you very much.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes, Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: So, long before I ran for office, I dealt with parking issues in neighborhoods, in our neighborhood. I live within a block of Le Jeune Road. There was a construction project coming in of a multi-story building on Le Jeune Road and spoke to neighbors, and we came up with a resolution and the neighbors voted to have --  one neighbor wanted grass put in, but we went with residential parking permit signs.   I warned my neighbor who parked all the time on his swale that his grass would not live, and it didn' t.  Because once you start driving on it, it dies.   The heat of the engine,  the wear and tear in the car, you have to irrigate it,  all those things go into grass or any planting.  And then we have other areas in our city that have high traffic. We have Venetian Pool, the Biltmore Hotel,  around the United Congregational Church of Christ. They have high traffic as well.  My neighborhood still had high traffic.   In fact, I had MercedesBenz employees parking at my property instead of them paying for parking for those folks.  So, I had a few words with Mercedes- Benz.   I said, I'll be darned if I'm going to pay for parking of my employee so they can park at the building and you' re burdening my property with all your employees.   So, there are solutions.   And I'd like to hear --  you know, I'd like for our Landscape Division to go out there and discuss some of the solutions with you all because,  if you want landscaping,  you' re going to lose parking.   If you want landscaping to live, you have to water it. You have to realize now you' re not\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARY BETH CONROY<|>PERSON<|>Reverend Mary Beth Conroy, speaker discussing property use and school-related issues, clarifying that the residence at 1100 Coral Way is used for clergy housing and not for children or classrooms.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST.
