We have Venetian Pool, the Biltmore Hotel,  around the United Congregational Church of Christ. They have high traffic as well.  My neighborhood still had high traffic.   In fact, I had MercedesBenz employees parking at my property instead of them paying for parking for those folks.  So, I had a few words with Mercedes- Benz.   I said, I'll be darned if I'm going to pay for parking of my employee so they can park at the building and you' re burdening my property with all your employees.   So, there are solutions.   And I'd like to hear --  you know, I'd like for our Landscape Division to go out there and discuss some of the solutions with you all because,  if you want landscaping,  you' re going to lose parking.   If you want landscaping to live, you have to water it. You have to realize now you' re not going to have the parking.   But there are other solutions if you do want parking for yourself,  for your guests,  such as we have the fancy coquina,  the nice gravel, all part of the swale package.   There are items in the swale package you can put in that require less water,  but I wouldn' t say that they need no water.   You have to get them established. And you can' t be parking on top of them,  you know.   One of the challenges that one of our residents has met is he put in landscaping and still, you know, people don' t care and they roll over it because it' s not their property.   So,  once upon a time,  we required FP&amp; L and Comcast to put plantings around their boxes.  Slowly but surely, that has come and rests upon the shoulders of the residents. I think if you want a planted swale,  you need to make some decisions on what you want,  because you' re going to have to maintain it.   Because if you don' t irrigate it,  you can' t expect it to live.  So, take a look at the residential parking permit program.   The residential parking permit signs are much,  much prettier.   Each one of us gets some emails from particular residents that don' t like parking signs.  They consider them ugly.  Why do we need all the signs?  We have sign pollution. But the ones that are residential parking permit are green poles,  extruded,  and a much nicer sign and blend in with the community and don' t upset some of those other residents we have in Coral Gables that don' t like ' No Parking' signs.   They call it sign pollution and they want to take the signs out.  In fact, in my neighborhood I'm getting a list of all the ' No Parking'  signs from all the neighbors that want them out so I can just have staff come out one time.  And --  but I would like staff to come out there and help advise between parking programs available. I can tell you the folks that face the Salvadore dog park, we had a long discussion about it.   I told them the options and they said if the parking became an issue on their side,  that they were going to go with the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential parking permit.   That was their choice.   And in closing,  I'll give you the history of the word swale.   I know it's funny.   It's a funny word.   I thought it was funny because no one else spoke it except for me at one point in time until I moved into Coral Gables.   And I learned that the etymology of it, at least locally here in the United States,  came from Pittsburgh.   And it's not a hidden fact that George Merrick came from the Pittsburgh area, the Philadelphia area.   And that is a word that was brought over from, you know, UK English descent type word.  So, you won' t find it heavily used outside of Coral Gables. It was transplanted here from the Northeast and they called it Pittsburgh- ese.   You can look at --  get a dictionary of Pittsburgh- ese and find it.  Soâ€¦\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Anybody else?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I do have a couple of comments. I'm in the area quite a bit during pickup and drop-off.  And I have to agree,  during drop-off, the park should not be an issue.   The park is not heavily used at drop-off time.  During pickup,  I do see your argument that the park is heavily used in the afternoon.   A lot of parents pick up their children from other schools and bring them to the park.   I think that' s something that as we continue to renovate our City parks and improve the City parks in other areas,  including Phillips Park,  hopefully beginning next year,  we will see some shift in that use,  but it is something that must be addressed. Because just seeing your pictures,  I've seen the cars parking in the swale every morning,  and I've seen the effect that it has on residences. Like Vice Mayor Anderson stated,  I myself have been a victim of people parking and blocking my driveway on a regular basis because of a business at the end of my block. So, I have seen that impact,  and in some cases,  we' ve tried to get the people to move and they just refused to do so.   We' ve had to call the police in order to get them out and remove them from blocking driveways.
