This notice serves to inform the public about the details of the hearing, including the date, time, location, and the decision-making body responsible for the hearing. It typically includes contact information such as phone numbers and email addresses, as well as the relevant application or hearing number, ensuring transparency and accessibility.\n\nThe notice is disseminated through multiple channels to comply with regulatory requirements. One method involves posting the notice directly on properties subject to the Special Certificate of Appropriateness request, providing immediate and visible information to affected parties. Additionally, the notice must be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. This publication provides at least 15 days' advance notice of the hearing, including a brief description of the proposed work and its location, allowing the broader community ample time to become informed and participate if desired.\n\nRegulations also specify that the notice be published at least ten days prior to the hearing date, ensuring sufficient public awareness before the City Commission convenes to consider the permit application. This multi-faceted approach to notification—through property postings and newspaper publications—ensures compliance with Article 15 of the relevant regulations and promotes public engagement in the decision-making process.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762927, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 272, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
