Specifically, it involves the publication of a notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the relevant jurisdiction, such as Coral Gables or Miami-Dade County. This notice typically sets forth proposed schedules of rates, fees, and charges related to sewage disposal systems or other municipal services.\n\nAccording to the requirements outlined, the publication must occur at least once and be made at least ten days prior to the final public hearing. This timeline ensures adequate public awareness and opportunity for community input. The publication serves as a formal method of notice delivery, complying with legal standards established under Florida Statutes Chapter 50. While the standard minimum notice period is ten days, some references indicate that timelines of seven to ten days may apply depending on the specific application or project context.\n\nOverall, \"PUBLICATION\" functions as a critical procedural step to guarantee transparency and public participation in governmental decision-making processes by providing timely and accessible information through authorized channels.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749563690, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 470, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
