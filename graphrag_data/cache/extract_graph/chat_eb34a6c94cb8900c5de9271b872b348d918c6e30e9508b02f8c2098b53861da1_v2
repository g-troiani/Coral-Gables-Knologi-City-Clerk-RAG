But I also have an issue with the encroachment in the residential neighborhoods. There has to be something done for the future.   We' ve got to start working together and planning.   I'm going to say something that you' re not going to like and maybe some of your residents may not like, but we need to figure out a way to either build some sort of parking structure,  one or two floors, something that works for the community that can be done in a way that, you know, wraps the first floor in maybe offices or educational because if they' re going to continue to expand,  you know, at the end of the day, you' re going to have to address the parking issue.   Because you' re not going to be able to meet the parking needs.   You' re not going to.  And there' s also --  I was looking at the minutes from the Planning and Zoning Board meeting. They were clear about,  obviously,  the swale package.   That already exists in the legislation,  it' s there.   I wrote that legislation.   It' s very simple.  It's something that, again, doesn' t cost anything.  The permit is free.  It gives you guidance in regards to a swale package to put on to basically avoid any parking on the swale.   Your biggest concern right now is the issue of parking and the condition of your swale,  correct?\n\nMs. Toyos:   Their growth.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Two.\n\nMayor Lago:   I understand\n\nthat.\n\nMs. Toyos:   We have two.\n\nMayor Lago:   But the growth thing is going to be a long-term issue that they' re going to have to work with their lawyers and the City to find a way to address it.   Because if you' re going to continue to grow,  and like you mentioned in other schools,  they don' t have the parking.   They don' t have the parking if they' re going to grow.  If they' re going to grow.  They haven' t told me they' re going to grow.   I don' t know anything about that.   But you' re making a statement that, obviously,  their plan is to continue to move --  to grow their footprint.\n\nMr. Toyos:   How many single-family homes are you going to keep on taking down?\n\nMayor Lago:   Again,  and I understand that,  but I just wanted to put it on the record that we' re going to have to find some sort of solution,  and the solution' s not going to make everybody happy.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Well, I think a parking lot there,  a structured -Mayor,  I think that you' re going to definitely get the neighbors…\n\nMayor Lago:   I'm just thinking --  and guess what, it's not going to happen.   Okay, but then let me tell you, then what do we do?  We' re going to park people,  let' s say,  at the Biltmore,  you know, and bring them in?\n\nMr. Toyos:  That' s --  you see,  you see, that --  this is where --  that' s not what we signed on for.\n\nMayor Lago:   I understand.\n\nMr. Toyos:  And let me tell you something.   They' re the ones who are expanding.   It' s not us.  We haven' t broken the covenant.   They have.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  Well, we don' t know if they broke the covenant or not, so let' s be very careful what we say here because,  at the end of the day, we' re under --  we' re all…\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to --?\n\nMayor Lago:   We' re here…\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to knock down this house according to the covenant?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   They are allowed to.   That' s my understanding. But again,  we deal with this, we deal with this with a lot of other schools that come before us.  For example,  Gulliver came before us in regards to an expansion of their footprint and they have to provide documents on a continual basis to show how many people are actually enrolled in the school.   A lot of schools have these covenants in place to show that they' re following the rules.   This is nothing new.   So, I have to look into that with the City Manager and my colleagues will do the same thing.   They' ll look at that with the City Manager and with Ms. Russo.   We' ll look at the documents to make sure that they' re adhering to the documents that must be submitted as per their agreement. If we' re not going to talk about expansion today,  that' s something that we' re going to talk about in the future, fine.   But I just want to put on the record,  there has to be --  a solution has to be found in the neighborhood,  because obviously,  this\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_eb34a6c94cb8900c5de9271b872b348d918c6e30e9508b02f8c2098b53861da1_v2"}
