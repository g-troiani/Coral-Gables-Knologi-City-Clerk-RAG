Key entities include Pole Owners, Utility and Communications Installations, Overhead Utility Lines, Redundant Poles, and Major Hardening Projects. Pole Owners are responsible for managing redundant poles created by undergrounding projects, including timely removal to comply with city codes and state laws. The relationships among these entities reflect a regulatory and operational framework governing infrastructure upgrades, rehabilitation projects, and compliance with Florida statutes, particularly F.S. § 366.97.\",\n  \"rating\": 6.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderately high due to the regulatory compliance requirements and potential operational disruptions associated with undergrounding utility infrastructure and redundant pole removal.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Pole Owners bear primary responsibility for redundant pole removal and regulatory compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Pole Owners are central actors in this community, tasked with the removal of redundant utility poles within 90 days following undergrounding projects to avoid code enforcement violations. This responsibility is critical to maintaining compliance with city orders and applicable laws, including Florida Statute § 366.97. Failure to remove redundant poles timely can lead to enforcement actions and operational risks. Additionally, Pole Owners must notify attaching entities and the city about redundant poles, ensuring transparency and coordination during infrastructure transitions. This regulatory obligation underscores the Pole Owners' pivotal role in managing the physical and legal aspects of utility infrastructure upgrades [Data: Entities (177, 185); Relationships (216, 217)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Utility and Communications Installations require undergrounding during major rehabilitation projects\",\n      \"explanation\": \"New construction and installations of utility and communications facilities are generally required to be underground unless they involve rehabilitation of structures valued at less than 50 percent. When rehabilitation projects exceed this 50 percent threshold, the installations must be converted from overhead to underground facilities. This requirement ensures modernization and resilience of utility infrastructure, reducing vulnerabilities associated with overhead lines. The relationship between Utility and Communications Installations and Rehabilitation of Structures highlights the regulatory trigger for undergrounding, emphasizing the importance of project valuation in compliance decisions [Data: Entities (183); Relationships (222)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Conversion of overhead utility lines to underground facilities generates redundant poles\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The process of converting existing overhead utility lines to underground facilities inherently results in the creation of redundant poles—utility poles that are no longer used for electrical distribution purposes. These redundant poles must be removed within 90 days by the Pole Owners to comply with city regulations and avoid enforcement actions. This relationship illustrates the operational impact of undergrounding projects, where physical infrastructure must be managed carefully to prevent safety hazards and maintain urban aesthetics.

Pole Owners engaged in these projects must notify the city and attaching entities, ensuring all stakeholders are informed of infrastructure changes. These projects represent significant investments in infrastructure resilience and reliability, often associated with regulatory scrutiny and coordination challenges.
