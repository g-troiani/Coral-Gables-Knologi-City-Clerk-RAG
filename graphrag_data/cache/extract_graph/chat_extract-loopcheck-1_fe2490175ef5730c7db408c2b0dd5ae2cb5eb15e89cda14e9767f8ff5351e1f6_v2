After the adoption by the commission of a resolution setting forth the preliminary schedule or schedules fixing and classifying such rates,  fees and charges,  notice of such public hearing,  setting forth the proposed schedule or schedules of rates,  fees and charges,  shall be given by one publication in a newspaper published in the city at least ten days before the date fixed in such notice for the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time.
