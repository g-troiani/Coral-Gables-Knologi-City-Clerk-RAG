And if the swale,  the Planning and Zoning Board is asking for cooperation from your client to put together some sort of swale package,  I want my -- I want input from my colleagues to see what do you think is the best opportunity,  and I know that Ms. Russo wants to respond,  so I'd like to hear from her first really quickly before we open up the (INAUDIBLE).   But we' ve got to find an answer here because it can' t be no swale package, then the only option that we have is we' ve got to get a public safety aide to basically be parked there,  you know, when school drop-off and pick up to make sure that nobody is encroaching or blocking the driveways.   Because,  by the way, we' ve dealt with this before.   We' ve dealt with it at Sunset.   We had multiple meetings on the ground.   I mean,  we had irate neighbors who were telling us, listen,  I couldn' t get out of my driveway for 45 minutes.   People were so desperate to avoid the line on Sunset that they would park their cars,  and then what ended up happening was, you know, I had to wait 45 minutes to go to work or to a doctor' s appointment because I couldn' t get out.  And this is nothing new.  It's just, again,  it' s one of the things that we' re dealing with as being one of the cities that everybody wants to live in and send their kids to school.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Mr. Mayor, I'm sensitive to the needs of the community in regards to how do you call it, their educational needs for the broader…\n\nMayor Lago:   But you also want quality of life and I respect that.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But specific to this location,  we' re probably at the point that we shouldn' t have been at because of prior decisions made here with single-family homes that shouldn' t have been schools with no parking.   Yeah,  I mean,  and for me to be given right now a solution that,  hey,  maybe we build a parking garage in this neighborhood,  that will go --  that' s going to go very…\n\nMayor Lago:   That wasn' t my intent.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   I know, I know.\n\nMayor Lago:   My intent was that we need to…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   You understand what I'm saying?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMayor Lago:   Find some sort of solutions…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Yeah.\n\nMayor Lago:   Outside of, you know, to alleviate parking.   And what are the two options?   Three options.   Either you bus people in from somewhere else, you build a surface parking lot.  For that, you got to buy more properties and knock them down,  or you have to build a parking structure. There' s no other way to do this.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Here' s the only solution I --  one of the…\n\nMayor Lago:   You already have parking issues.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We already have parking issues,  but we also have single-family home that has been purchased by the school,  which has single-family zoning.   And I'm bringing it to your attention today on this date.  So, go --  let it go on the record,  okay…\n\nMs. Tuyos:   That' s what they' re doing.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   That we do not want this continued expansion of single- family zoning and singlefamily homes,  okay, being built into future classroom space.\n\nMayor Lago:   I want to address one point before we hear from Ms. Russo,  okay.   So,  we can approve today,  moving on to second reading,  but one of the things that I would want is for there to be a real discussion between you and the school' s representative,  Russo,  and that the Manager' s team be engaged on that front.  Because there has to be -- I will not approve this on second reading if we don' t have a solution to, at a minimum --  because we' re not going to find a parking solution today,  okay,  and we' re not going to find it in the next five years. You know,  we have,  at a minimum,  we have to find something so that your quality of life is not impacted,  okay?  I haven' t been on the ground to see the, you know,  drop-off and pickup.   I've done it in other schools.   I know my colleagues have also.   So,  this is something that maybe we should see firsthand what we' re having. And I've done it where we don' t even -we don' t announce that we' re going because I want to see it when it's…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Really happening not where…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Let' s do it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_260a4a0ed30e801b4a05cbc231f28a5a1f2a88476eb5bbdff0f30147b8f43de8_v2"}
