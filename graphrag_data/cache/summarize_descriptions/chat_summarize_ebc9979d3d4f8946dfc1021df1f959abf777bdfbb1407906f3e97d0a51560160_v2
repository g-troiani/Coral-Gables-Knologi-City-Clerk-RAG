It includes various provisions that outline the procedures and exceptions applicable to public purchasing. Notably, Section 2-691 of the Procurement Code allows for waivers of competitive processes under certain circumstances, providing flexibility when strict competition is not feasible or practical. Additionally, the Code encompasses Sections 2-946 and 2-947, which address piggyback and cooperative purchasing. These sections enable entities to leverage existing contracts or collaborate with other organizations to procure goods and services more efficiently and cost-effectively.
