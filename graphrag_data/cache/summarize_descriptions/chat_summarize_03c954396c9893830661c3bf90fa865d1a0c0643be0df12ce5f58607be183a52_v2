The program focuses on coordinating and funding operations that target drug trafficking organizations to reduce the production, distribution, and use of illegal drugs. One notable component of the HIDTA Program is its support for specialized task forces, such as the South Florida Money Laundering Strike Force, which works to disrupt the financial networks that underpin drug trafficking activities. By providing resources, intelligence sharing, and operational support, the HIDTA Program plays a critical role in strengthening law enforcement capabilities to combat drug trafficking in regions identified as having significant drug-related challenges.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749145742, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 372, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
