Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this resolution document. The user wants only the code, like E-2 or H-1, and if it's not there, say NOT_FOUND. Let me start by reading through the entire document carefully.

Looking at the first page, the resolution number is 2024-07. The document talks about waiving the competitive process for continuing purchases from AT&T. There are several WHEREAS clauses and sections, but I don't see an agenda item code mentioned here yet.

Moving to the second page, after the sections, there's a part with "AgendaItem: H-2)" right before the Approved section. That looks like the code. Let me check again to make sure there's no other code mentioned elsewhere. Scanning back through the first page again, I don't see any other references. The key line is "AgendaItem: H-2)" at the end. So the code should be H-2. I need to confirm that this is the correct format they want, which is just the letters and number. Since it's there, the answer is H-2. If I missed it, maybe check the headers or footers, but in the provided text, that's the only mention. Alright, that's the one.
