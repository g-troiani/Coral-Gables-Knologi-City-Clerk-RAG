Since late last year, he has worked closely with city staff on ordinances, particularly those related to signage and window/hurricane shutter regulations, advocating for balanced approaches that consider both safety and aesthetics. He supports adding a 30-day warning period before enforcement actions, such as shutter removal, to provide residents with adequate notice.\n\nA consistent advocate for community input, Commissioner Fernandez has proposed hosting meetings with realtors and Chamber of Commerce members to discuss signage improvements in the Central Business District, emphasizing the need for uniformity in signage regulations while recognizing the differences between residential and commercial contexts.
