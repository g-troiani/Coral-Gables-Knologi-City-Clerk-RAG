Since marketing in this sector is heavily dependent on signage to attract potential customers, these restrictions could substantially reduce the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. This impact is critical because signage serves as a primary tool for visibility and communication of available properties to prospective tenants or buyers. The ordinance's influence on marketing strategies could lead to decreased market reach and slower leasing or sales processes for commercial properties.

The ability to effectively market office space directly affects occupancy rates and revenue generation for property owners and managers. Given that office space is a key entity in this community, its reliance on marketing underscores the importance of signage as a communication and advertising medium. Any limitations on marketing tools, such as those imposed by the proposed ordinance, could therefore have a direct negative impact on office space leasing activities.

These economic impacts could affect landlords, tenants, and investors alike, highlighting the importance of carefully evaluating the ordinance's implications.
