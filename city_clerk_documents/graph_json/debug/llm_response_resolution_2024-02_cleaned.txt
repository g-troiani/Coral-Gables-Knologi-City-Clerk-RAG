Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the given resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by reading through the document text carefully. The document is titled "RESOLUTION NO. 2024-02" and it's about confirming the appointment of John "Miles" Maronto to the Transportation Advisory Board. 

Looking at the sections, they mention the resolution's sections 1, 2, and 3. Then there's a part where it says "PASSED AND ADOPTED THIS NINTHDAYOFJANUARY, A.D., 2024." Following that, there's a line with "Moved: Anderson / Seconded: Fernandez)" and then "Unanimous Voice Vote)". 

The next line is crucial: "AgendaItem: D-2)". Here, it explicitly states "AgendaItem" followed by "D-2". The parentheses at the end might be a typo, but the code is clearly D-2. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning the rest, there's the approved section with names and titles, and a DocuSign ID, but nothing else related to an agenda item. 

The user specified to return ONLY the code in the format AGENDA_ITEM: [code]. The example shows something like E-2 or F-10, so D-2 fits that pattern. The key is to ensure there's no other code mentioned. Since this is the only instance, I can confirm that D-2 is the correct code. No need to overcomplicate; just extract that part.


AGENDA_ITEM: D-2
