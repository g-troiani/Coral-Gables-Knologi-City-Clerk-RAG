rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

It was posted twice,  three times website posting and once for newspaper advertisements. So,  staff has determined that it' s consistent with the comp plan and it complies with all the findings of fact, which is part of your packet and the staff report today.   So,  there' s two conditions of approval. The first one is the non-operable fixed windows on the façade facing the adjacent abutting neighbor to the east.   The swale improvements on the front, and as she indicated,  the Planning and Zoning Board wanted to expand that and have it on Cordova as well between Coral Way and Andalusia to prevent parking and other issues that the school,  I guess,  has been dealing with for quite some time.  And all the conditions that are listed in Ordinance Number 3576 would still remain in effect. That' s it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Thank you.\n\nMs. Russo:  And if you want to see, I have a little PowerPoint that just shows you a little bit, if we can get it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Perfect,  thank you.\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Could we get the applicant PowerPoint,  please?  Press the big button.\n\nMs. Russo:  Next slide.   Alright,  this is the existing building,  so this is the building that' s being replaced,  the one again on the southeast corner of the campus.   This is the new proposed building. This is the area behind the school,  behind that particular building.   And this is existing.   And you can see there is a -- this particular house had an old detached garage that actually sat on the property\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nline.  So, one of the requirements of the original site plan is if this building ever came down, that garage that' s on the property line would have to be removed and needless to say, all setbacks would have to be observed.   This is what the back will look at.  It will now be set back from the neighbor to the east. And again,  the building that you see without the arches is the one that faces the neighbor and that has the blank wall.   The building with the arches is the one that will have the fixed inoperable windows near the front. This is what the space will look like. This is the multipurpose space.   I'm sorry, the other were the classrooms.   This is the multipurpose space that will also be able to work so that activities,  depending on weather,  as you can see,  it opens up to the backyard.   And that' s it.   I just wanted you to get a little glimpse of what we' re doing.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Mr. Mayor, we have several members of the public requesting to speak on this item.  The first is Norma Perez.\n\nMs. Russo:   She' s decided not to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Okay.\n\nMs. Russo:   They just signed in in case they wanted to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Edward Diaz.  Mary Conroy.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nMary Conroy:   Hi, I'm Mary Beth Conroy.   I'm the rector of St. Philip' s.   I've been here for 14 years.   And when I moved here,  I thought I had a great vocabulary,  but I did not know the word swale.   And so,  I've learned something about it.  And thanks to my friendly parishioners,  they taught me that I was to maintain my swale and that it did not belong to me.   And so,  for all the many years I've lived here,  I have replanted my swale,  like I'm sure many of you have.   I've endured neighbors doing construction projects joyfully,  and I'm happy to be in a community that works together so that we can live together in harmony. I will say that St.  Philip' s is in a neighborhood that' s in high demand for parking and we struggle with the same issues that our neighbors do and those who want to attend and use the glorious park that has been provided by the City.   It has only increased and become more challenging. And as Ms. Russo pointed out,  we continue to ask people to rideshare when we have big events,  whether it's a large funeral,  whether it' s a big event for the school.   We ask people to observe ' No Parking'  signs, to be mindful of the neighbors' driveways for their own safety.   And we try in every way we can to be a good and gracious neighbor.   And we' re happy to work with the City and with all of our neighbors and all the constituents to try to find reasonable solutions.   But I strongly believe that asking St. Philip' s\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nto take on in perpetuity to plant and maintain a non-adjacent neighbor swale is not only unfair, it's unneighborly. And so,  we' re here to really ask your permission to build a new building for our youngest learners.   And I hope you will support us.   Thank you.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Octavio\n\nSanturio.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, he' s --  no.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Cecilia Slesnick.\n\nCecelia Slesnick:   Good morning,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE 3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance Number 3576, which contains conditions that remain in effect related to the property and site plan discussed, including requirements for setbacks and removal of structures such as a detached garage on the property line.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, during which discussions about property improvements, conditions of approval, and public comments took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS.
