The park is situated adjacent to a parking lot behind Giralda Plaza, and efforts to enhance the park’s usability and appeal have considered ways to better connect it with this nearby lot. However, several challenges complicate these plans, including limited alley access, the presence of entrances and exits to neighboring buildings, and the need to address street closure requirements. These factors require careful planning to ensure that any improvements to Pittman Park respect the surrounding infrastructure and maintain accessibility while enhancing the park’s function as a public space. Overall, Pittman Park is recognized as a valuable community asset with opportunities for thoughtful development that balances activation with the constraints posed by its urban context.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749563713, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 378, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
