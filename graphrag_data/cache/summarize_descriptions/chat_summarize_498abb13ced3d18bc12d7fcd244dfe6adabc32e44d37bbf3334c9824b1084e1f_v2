Specifically, it involves publishing notices in newspapers of general circulation to inform the public about important regulatory and procedural matters. One application of newspaper publication is to serve notice of failure to convert utility service facilities. In this case, the notice must be published at least twice in a newspaper of general circulation, with a minimum interval of seven days between the publications, and the first publication must occur at least 30 days before the required conversion date. Another use of newspaper publication is to announce public hearings on proposed rates, fees, and charges. For this purpose, a single publication in a newspaper published within the city is sufficient, and it must be published at least ten days prior to the hearing date. Together, these practices ensure that the public is adequately informed about utility service changes and regulatory proceedings through timely and accessible newspaper notices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762921, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
