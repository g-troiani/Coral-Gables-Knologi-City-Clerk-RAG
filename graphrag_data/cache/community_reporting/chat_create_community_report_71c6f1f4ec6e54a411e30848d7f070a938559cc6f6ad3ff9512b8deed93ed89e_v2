This amendment applies uniform regulations to signs related to the sale, lease, or rental of properties across all use districts within the city. The ordinance’s focus on signage size and placement reflects an effort to standardize visual elements in urban spaces, potentially affecting commercial visibility and neighborhood aesthetics.

The amendment via Agenda Item E-8 impacts these signage regulations, indicating a city-wide effort to harmonize signage standards across multiple districts.
