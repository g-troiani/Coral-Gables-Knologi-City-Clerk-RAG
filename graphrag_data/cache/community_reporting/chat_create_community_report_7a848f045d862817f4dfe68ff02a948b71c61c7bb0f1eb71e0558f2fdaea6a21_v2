It strategically links parking requirement discounts to the proximity of housing projects to transit options, such as rail stations and bus stops, thereby incentivizing transit-oriented development. This program's design aims to reduce the need for extensive parking infrastructure, which can lower construction costs and encourage higher urban density. By doing so, it supports sustainable growth and aligns with broader urban planning goals to reduce reliance on private vehicles.

Defined as residential housing eligible for parking discounts when located near transit, workforce housing aims to provide affordable living options for working individuals and families. The program's tiered parking reductions are designed to enhance affordability by lowering parking-related costs, which can be a significant factor in housing expenses. This targeted approach supports the development of accessible and cost-effective housing along transit corridors, promoting equitable access to public transportation and employment opportunities.

For example, parcels located within 500 feet of a rail station can qualify for up to a 100 percent reduction in parking requirements. This tiered approach adjusts incentives according to the accessibility of various transit options, including rail stations and bus stops, encouraging developers to prioritize locations with better transit connectivity. By aligning parking policies with transit proximity, the program promotes transit-oriented development, which can reduce traffic congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and improve overall urban livability.

This integration supports increased transit ridership and reduces dependence on private vehicles, contributing to environmental sustainability and improved urban mobility. The program's focus on transit-oriented development aligns with contemporary urban planning principles that emphasize connectivity and accessibility.
