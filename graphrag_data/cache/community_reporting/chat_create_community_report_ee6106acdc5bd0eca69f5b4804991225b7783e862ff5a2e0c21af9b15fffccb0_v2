The Act mandates local governments to amend zoning codes, particularly by easing parking, height, and density limitations for affordable housing projects near major transit stops. Key entities include the Live Local Act itself, Senate Bill 102 (its legislative identifier), Coral Gables' mixed-use districts (MX1, MX2, MX3), and definitions and metrics related to affordable housing such as the Miami-Dade County AMI.

It specifically requires consideration or allowance of reduced parking requirements for affordable housing projects near major transit stops, facilitating transit-oriented development. The Act became effective on July 1, 2023, marking a legislative milestone aimed at easing development standards to promote affordable housing. This law also authorizes the development of affordable housing units under these revised standards, indicating a direct influence on housing policy and urban development in Coral Gables and potentially other Florida localities [Data: Entities (801); Relationships (1137, 1174, 1177, 1175, 1178)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Preemption of local zoning regulations including height and density limits\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A key feature of the Live Local Act is its preemption of local zoning regulations that previously limited development potential. Specifically, the Act overrides height limitations in Coral Gables' mixed-use districts MX2 and MX3 by allowing the highest building height within a one-mile radius of the development site. Similarly, it preempts density limitations by requiring a citywide analysis for affordable housing developments, superseding the prior maximum of 125 units per acre. These regulatory changes are designed to remove barriers to affordable housing construction, enabling higher density and taller buildings where appropriate. This preemption reflects a significant shift in local land use control in favor of state-level affordable housing objectives [Data: Entities (851, 852); Relationships (1177, 1178)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Integration with Coral Gables' mixed-use districts\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Live Local Act specifically targets affordable housing development within Coral Gables' three mixed-use zoning districts: MX1, MX2, and MX3. These districts cover strategic geographic areas including the northern city along 8th Street (MX1), Ponce de Leon Boulevard and downtown (MX3), and the Design and Innovation District along U.S.-1 and the urban center near South Miami. By focusing on these districts, the Act leverages existing mixed-use zones to facilitate affordable housing projects, aligning housing development with areas of commercial and urban activity.

Miami-Dade County's AMI, set at $74,700, serves as the reference point for determining rent limits in Coral Gables under the Live Local Act. This linkage ensures that affordable housing projects comply with income-based affordability standards, providing a measurable and enforceable criterion for eligibility. The use of Miami-Dade County AMI grounds the Act's provisions in local economic realities, enhancing its relevance and effectiveness [Data: Entities (848, 849); Relationships (1179)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Senate Bill 102 as the legislative identity of the Live Local Act\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Senate Bill No. 102 is the formal legislative designation of the Live Local Act, effective July 1, 2023.

The bill's passage represents a significant state-level intervention in local housing policy, providing both regulatory changes and financial resources to support affordable housing development.
