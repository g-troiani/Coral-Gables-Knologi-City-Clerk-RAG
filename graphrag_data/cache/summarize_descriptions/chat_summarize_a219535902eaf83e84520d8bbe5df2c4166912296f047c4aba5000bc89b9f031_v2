It is a neighborhood-focused project designed to improve and manage swale areas—landscaped strips typically used for drainage—by incorporating native plant materials, gravel, and other elements. The primary goals of the Swale Package are to enhance the aesthetic and environmental quality of neighborhood swales while addressing parking-related concerns.\n\nSpecifically, the project aims to prevent parking on designated swale areas, which has been a source of neighborhood issues, particularly near St. Philip's School. The package includes measures that would make parking enforcement possible through resident calls, thereby empowering the community to help maintain the intended use of these spaces. By managing parking more effectively, the Swale Package seeks to improve safety and overall neighborhood conditions.\n\nIn summary, the Swale Package is a proposed set of landscaping and parking management measures focused on neighborhood swales, combining environmental improvements with practical enforcement strategies to address resident concerns about parking and safety around school properties and other community areas.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749233503, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
