Basically,  they were hand made for us, so the ornaments that are hanging from the trees and the ones that are on the median,  the stars that are on the median,  that is the only thing that we will continue with for the next three years.  So, two more years we' ve got of that. And then everything else,  so about $ 64,000, we have the ability to go out and we are going to go out to get bids for the rest of those decorations.  We did that because we, you know, I hear you Commissioner,  but I think decorations are really subjective.  Some people could like it, some people not,  and so we really wanted to start with a pallet where you could see decorations.  Last year the ones that we had were one ornament per block,  that' s the only thing we were able to get, and it was lit at night as well, also had a lighting component to it, but there was only one per block. I really don' t think that was enough for the street.  I don' t think it was significant enough for the type of street that we have.\n\nMayor Lago: If I may, if you would educate the Commission.  Over the last few years, we' ve been talking about the lack of lighting,  full-time lighting throughout the year of the oak trees,  and obviously,  Christmas Tree lighting.  That to me, has been,  I think is priority number one.  When you talk about Christmas -  the ornaments are beautiful,  I want to see lights.  I want to see lights hanging from the oak trees.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  You mean like the full year.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  I wouldn' t have an issue with it. I don' t have an issue with it. But that' s something that people have talked to me about it,  and it makes a lot of sense.  We could do something beautiful,  well done, tasteful,  doesn' t have to be bright neon.  It could be a softer color, but I think that it would benefit the street significantly and it would give a festive kind of feel to it throughout\n\nCity Commission Meeting the year.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  The lighting is really what detracted from the decorations,  because you couldn' t even see them. The stars on the palm trees, I was hard-pressed to find them, because you could see where they were.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  At night.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  So, two things.  The string lights that are on the trees that are on Miracle Mile, the swales,  they are currently lit only up to the trunk.  So, this was a project that was put in place to replace those,  that was a project that had been started by the former Business Improvement District.  They paid 50 percent of it. We are picking it up as part of the budget process.  We did ask for the $79,000 that it would cost to complete that project,  and so,  I did receive that.  That is going to be a project that' s going to start in February.  We didn' t want to do it in the middle of the holiday season,  because we weren' t sure when it would be done, and so because our budget just started in October,  we wanted to have enough time to be able to have it. So that' s a year- round lighting that would be installed,  and we have talked to that vendor,  and they know that they need to go up some of the branches.  I'm not sure how many string lights were purchased,  because it' s not our project,  but we want to go up.\n\nMayor Lago:  But this is something that we' ve been talking about,  Commissioner,  for two years. I know the BID fell apart and everything that happened,  but I want to make sure that we deliver on that this year, if possible.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I had a lot of feedback and even in our comments in the community and I think the Mayor was touching upon it. I would love to have Miracle Mile be a go-to place in the holiday season for folks to come to Miracle Mile to see.  In my perfect world, Miracle Mile should glow during the winter, during the holidays,  glow, and people like, hey, let' s drive to Coral Gables Miracle Mile so we can just see how beautifully lit and create sort of a winter wonderland concept. I think that' s what -  without that we can put all the decorations possible on trees and it will look like Charlie Brown' s Christmas Tree which sort of you know,  tips over.  I would like to create, what is it, the wow. I want people to feel wow and the lighting is the key,  I think,  and since the Mayor did mention that we have Commissioner Castro,  Commissioner Fernandez weren' t here when the whole BID\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, who is actively involved in discussions about spending on park and Miracle Mile decorations and lighting, emphasizing the importance of lighting on oak trees and holiday decorations on Miracle Mile.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR PEREZ<|>PERSON<|>Economic Development Director Perez, who provides detailed budget and project information regarding Miracle Mile and Giralda holiday decorations, including costs, purchases, and plans for lighting installations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, who comments on the lighting quality of decorations, noting that poor lighting detracted from the visibility of stars on palm trees during the holiday season.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, who expresses community feedback and a vision for Miracle Mile to be a well-lit, attractive holiday destination, emphasizing the importance of lighting to create a festive atmosphere.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRACLE MILE HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>PROJECT<|>Miracle Mile holiday decorations project, involving both purchased and rented ornaments, handmade decorations including stars on medians and trees, with a budget of approximately $147,000 allocated for decorations and plans for future bids to complete additional decorations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIRALDA HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>PROJECT<|>Giralda holiday decorations project, included in the combined budget of $147,000 with Miracle Mile decorations, involving holiday lighting and ornaments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLIDAY DECORATIONS BUDGET<|>MONEY<|>Budget of $150,000 allocated for Miracle Mile and Giralda holiday decorations, with $147,000 spent so far on decorations and $64,000 planned for future bids to complete additional decorations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAR-ROUND LIGHTING PROJECT<|>PROJECT<|>Year-round lighting project for Miracle Mile trees, intended to extend lighting beyond the trunk up into the branches, costing $79,000, partially funded by the former Business Improvement District (BID) which paid 50%, with the City picking up the remainder as part of the budget process, scheduled to start in February.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORMER BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT (BID)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Former Business Improvement District (BID), which initiated the year-round lighting project on Miracle Mile trees and contributed 50% of the funding before its dissolution.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR PEREZ<|>MIRACLE MILE HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>Economic Development Director Perez provides budget details and project status for Miracle Mile holiday decorations, including costs and plans for future bids.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR PEREZ<|>GIRALDA HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>Economic Development Director Perez reports combined budget and spending for Miracle Mile and Giralda holiday decorations.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLIDAY DECORATIONS BUDGET<|>MIRACLE MILE HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>The budget of $150,000 includes $147,000 spent on Miracle Mile holiday decorations.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLIDAY DECORATIONS BUDGET<|>GIRALDA HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>The budget of $150,000 includes spending on Giralda holiday decorations.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YEAR-ROUND LIGHTING PROJECT<|>FORMER BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT (BID)<|>The former BID funded 50% of the year-round lighting project on Miracle Mile trees before its dissolution.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YEAR-ROUND LIGHTING PROJECT<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR PEREZ<|>Economic Development Director Perez manages the year-round lighting project, including budget approval and scheduling.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>YEAR-ROUND LIGHTING PROJECT<|>Mayor Lago emphasizes the importance of delivering the year-round lighting project this year and discusses its priority with the Commission.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>MIRACLE MILE HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>Commissioner Fernandez comments on the poor lighting of decorations on Miracle Mile, affecting visibility.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>MIRACLE MILE HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>Commissioner Menendez expresses community feedback and vision for Miracle Mile decorations and lighting to create a festive, attractive holiday destination.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR PEREZ<|>Mayor Lago questions and discusses budget and decoration details with Economic Development Director Perez.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
