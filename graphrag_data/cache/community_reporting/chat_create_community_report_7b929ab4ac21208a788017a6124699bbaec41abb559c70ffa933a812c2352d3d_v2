This resolution is reviewed and decided upon by the City Commission during their regularly scheduled meetings following a request submission. Its primary function is to allow City staff adequate time to conduct a comprehensive analysis and prepare detailed reports, including proposed ordinance amendments and recommendations. The resolution period is initially fixed but can be extended under specific conditions, reflecting its flexibility to accommodate complex zoning issues.

These extensions are critical for cases where City staff require more time to complete their analysis and reporting.

This moratorium period is initially fixed and shall not exceed ninety (90) days, during which City staff are tasked with preparing a comprehensive report, including proposed ordinance amendments and recommendations, to be presented to both the Planning and Zoning Board and the City Commission.\n\nThe resolution period, including any moratorium, is limited to the first regularly scheduled City Commission meeting after 120 days from the date of approval. However, this period may be extended by up to 40 days if additional time is necessary. Extensions beyond this 40-day period can also be granted by the City Commission if deemed necessary and in the public interest.
