Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the provided ordinance document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the format like E-2 or F-10, etc. If there's none, return NOT_FOUND.

First, I'll start by scanning the entire text provided. The document is labeled as Ordinance No. 2024-01 from the City of Coral Gables. The user mentioned that the example responses include something like "AgendaItem: E-1". Let me check the document again carefully.

Looking at the end of the document, after the sections and the voting details, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-1)". That looks exactly like what they're asking for. The format matches the examples givenâ€”letters and numbers separated by a hyphen. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning through the "WHEREAS" clauses and the sections, I don't see any other references to an agenda item code. The only instance is that line right before the signatures. 

The code here is "E-1". The user specified to return only the code in the exact format, so I should present it as AGENDA_ITEM: E-1. No other parts are needed. Also, since it's present, NOT_FOUND isn't applicable here. Double-checking to ensure there's no typo or alternative code. Yep, that's the only one. Got it.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-1
