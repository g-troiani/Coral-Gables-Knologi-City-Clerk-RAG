( Sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez)\n\nMayor Lago:  F-10.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  F-10 is a Resolution of the City Commission directing the City Clerk and City Manager to schedule bimonthly presentation and protocol ceremonies.\n\nDeputy City Attorney Throckmorton:  Good afternoon again.  I'll just give you a brief overview of the resolution presented to you today,  sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez.  This resolution directs that the City Clerk and City Manager schedule bimonthly morning ceremonies at the Police and Fire Headquarters,  dedicated solely to presentations and protocol documents that section of the agenda.  The exact day and month of the ceremony may be moved occasionally to accommodate\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nstaff and the City Commission and the general public and as time and urgency demand we may still have presentation and protocol documents on our regular City Commission agenda,  as drafted.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  So, I had brought this up early on, I think back in April. We have had a couple of discussions about it. Our Human Resources Department has gone back and done a survey of staff. From the numbers that were presented to me, Police was overwhelmingly in favor of moving the presentation protocols to this format;  Fire was pretty much an even split;  general employees were the ones that were in favor of keeping them here, but as the months have gone on, I think we have seen that we have residents in the room who are here to address items,  members of the community,  the Chamber,  and we continue to have lengthy presentation and protocol,  which I think would benefit from a specific forum where we are properly honoring the individuals or the organizations that are being honored in presentation and protocols,  so I wanted to bring it back and make a motion to move forward with having a specific ceremony to honor these individuals and these organizations that' s not on the Commission meetings so that we can focus our Commission meetings on Commission business.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Mayor,  if I may.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes,  go ahead.  I was going to address it. We just got an interesting email that I wanted to show you. May I Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes, I received it as well. Nadine Aleman who was here this morning.\n\nMayor Lago:  Will you put that up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: ' Good afternoon,  all: This morning, I had the honor of being present at the commission meeting to witness a proud moment: my son, Officer Michael Aleman, receiving an award.  The experience was not just a personal highlight for our family but was made extra special by the setting-a platform where his dedication and accomplishments were recognized before the public eye. The presentation and the heartfelt words spoken during the meeting added an invaluable layer of significance.\n\nIntegrating awards to our police officers into commission meetings amplifies the significance of their achievements within the broader community.  By incorporating these recognitions into such sessions,  we emphasize the importance of law enforcement in our society and showcase the commitment and sacrifices made. This is true for all our first responders and public service members.  This inclusion allows for a broader audience, from community members to local officials, to witness and appreciate the commendable work done.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nConducting these award ceremonies within commission meetings offers a powerful message of support and appreciation for our police force. It underlines the transparency and accountability of our governing bodies,  ensuring that the commendable actions of officers are acknowledged in an open and inclusive environment.  This recognition not only boosts the morale of our officers but also fosters a stronger bond between law enforcement and the community they serve,  promoting a sense of unity and mutual respect.\n\nI want to thank you for setting the stage with your continued support and inclusion of these important recognitions during commission meetings. It is an incredibly meaningful and impactful way to honor their service while fostering a deeper connection between the community and those who serve and protect it.'   I understand your point and we all can do our part on reducing the length of some of our comments,  but I read this into the record to make very,  very clear the feelings of the individuals that were here this morning and if we reflect upon the last Sunshine meeting that we were at regarding proposed change of our zoning code,  I think we had 8 or 9 individuals from the public there. It's a huge difference when you have people here that watch Commission meetings and watch reruns of Commission meetings,  they are unlikely to be watching reruns of a separate meeting at a separate time, because they are interested really in what' s happening here at our Commission every day, what is it that we' re doing.  So, I think that Mrs. Aleman' s comments adequately summarize my viewpoint on this and where I stand on it. I think it' s really important that we honor our first responders in a respectful manner and not in a separate meeting where they are less important and like second class citizens.\n\nMayor Lago: So, if I may, I want to dovetail off your comments.  I wholeheartedly agree with you. So,  this was sent to the entire Commission at 12:46 ( pm)  and it caught me off guard,  because it was very well written and she was so adamant about honoring,  about having her son honored before the Commission.  The Commission requested for a poll to be compiled and we went through the process to really understand what the residents, excuse me,  what the employees wanted, whether they are Police, Fire,  or General Employees, they are employees. What were the percentages in that number?\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  The survey was conducted by HR.\n\nDeputy City Attorney Throckmorton: I'll ask the Human Resources Director to answer those questions for you.\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  Good afternoon.  The survey was conducted back in August of last year, 2023.  So,  205 employees responded that they would like to keep the current practice of being recognized here before City Commission and 174 employees responded that they would like a separate ceremony.\n\nMayor Lago:  My point is that, listen,  it's something that works. If you look at it today,  right now it' s 2 o' clock,  we have three items left that are City Manager items that we' ll fly by them.  We' ll be out of here by 2:30. I think, again,  when you talk about the employees,  all the employees that\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nI've talked to, they like to have these meetings be present before the Commission,  and I don' t think it' s really that much of a big deal.  We went through the process to get input from the employees, they like it here, we want to move forward with that, and I think its appropriate also when you hear from parents and from individuals who are being honored before the Commission, its their moment.  Its their moment to shine,  its their moment to highlight all the great things that they do for the residents or for the business community,  and I think it just makes sense to keep it here.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I don' t think moving it diminishes the recognition and I think the Vice Mayor' s comments of calling it second class citizens is inflammatory and unnecessary.  The change is just about making sure that the focus of the Commission during Commission meetings can be focused on the needs of residents and the recognition still takes place in a forum which is specific to the recognition,  and I think the conversation that we' ve had and even Commissioner Castro added to make sure that there was some sort of reception following so that they could interact with the members of the Commission, not spend two seconds here taking a photo with a quick handshake and a photo.  I think it's a place where we could focus on the individuals and focus on those that are being recognized and making sure that they are properly recognized,  and the focus of the Commission during Commission meetings is Commission meetings. I've had several Commission meetings since August,  where the presentation and protocols have been close to an hour and forty-five minutes,  and that' s time that could have been focused on the residents who are in the room waiting for their items to be called up. In some cases,  time certain items that weren' t called up on time certain times, because we weren' t able to get to them on time, and we' ve had at least one instance where a member of the Commission was interrupted because another person had to leave the room and we wanted to make sure that they spoke.  We wouldn' t have gotten to that point had we had a specific ceremony for our employees and for the presentation and protocol and that' s the reason that I'm moving forward with this today.\n\nMayor Lago: But I think you also have to also come to terms and it' s the same situation we' ve had in the past with other decisions this Commission has made.  Let' s test the waters with the employees,  okay.  The employees still vote one way,  we' re going to vote against the employees. For example,  the same thing we were talking about the possibility of doing November elections on -  let' s do November elections,  let' s get the pulse of the community and let' s vote on it. Now we don' t want to vote on it. To me, I just think that it's - you may want that, and I understand that, but at the end of the day, the employees who are the ones being recognized are the ones saying we prefer to be in the Commission Chambers.  Honor our request.  If it was the other way around,  205 people were against it, I'd say listen,  let' s move forward with what the employee wants.  I don' t have an issue with it. It's not the first time that we changed gears on issues,  but I just think, with all due respect,  I think it's more agenda- driven than it is actually driven to benefit the employees.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  I commend you for bringing this back. Thank you very much. I thought this was a lost item. I sincerely think that the way that the survey was worded was not the best outcome, because I don' t think the words,  the questions were to really make the employees understand that this was something special for them and as far as me, I could pledge to be there every single time in any award ceremony, so that makes it any more special. I don' t know if the rest of the\n\nCommission is going to be there. I'm pretty sure most of us will be there and it will be even more special.  So, with all my heart I support this.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  My question is for the administration for the Clerk' s office,  because I think this occurred,  this issue came up because right after the elections we were having an hourand-a-half,  two-hour presentations in protocol section and it was meeting after meeting after meeting,  and we were here 9, 10, 11 hours at the end of the day, and how can -  I'm looking for solutions.  How can we better manage that situation.  Are we the only city that has protocols before the Commission meetings?  Do some have it at noon? I'm looking for something other than one or the other. Is there a hybrid? - because an hour-and- a-half, two hours which everybody is deserving, the people that are recognized,  obviously today was a perfect example,  but why are we having an hour-and-a-half to two-hour protocols when there are folks with items that we need to get to.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And to answer your question,  Commissioner,  this would still allow for certain items to come before the Commission on the date. This would not preclude us from having presentations and protocols during this meeting.  It would move so that items that are known to be at a certain time and our recognition of our employees to have a special ceremony to recognize them.  So, it is a hybrid which we worked out from the conversations that came about during our initial Commission meeting.  Originally,  the resolution that I had presented was everything would be moved to this ceremony.  This is more of a hybrid based on the input that was gathered during the Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Commissioner Menendez,  I want to give you another opportunity.  Excuse me.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You' re a little funny sometimes but continue.  Another opportunity.  Go. I'm listening.\n\nMayor Lago:  Another opportunity to kind of see it another way.  When Mayor Valdes- Fauli was here,  we used to start the Commission meeting earlier and it was seamless,  and it wasn' t an issue. We had it downstairs.  I think people enjoyed it. It wasn' t an issue. We started 30-45 minutes early. We got here probably at 9:15 and we moved forward pretty quickly.  For some reason I thought that maybe being outside pushed the protocol documents faster,  maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like it was kind of a much faster process.  I said,  let' s get here earlier and let' s get it done.  I'm more than willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning,  at 8:30, get it done,  and we meet the goals of the employees who they stated very clearly by the poll that we took that they would rather have it here and we meet the goal of getting here as quickly as possible and the residents can get here at 9 o' clock, 9:15, to have their items heard in a timely manner without any delays from the protocol section of the meeting.  Does that opportunity work for you?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s definitely one option.  I know we discussed that when this first came up.  Other than presentations and obviously the recognition,  Employee of the Month,  its September so we' re recognizing, is there a way to manage how many protocol items are per Commission meeting?  Can we cap it a little bit better because if you look at it, there are months\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nthat we have an hour-and-a-half, two hours, and then there are other meetings that we have, we' re done in 40 minutes or 35 minutes.  Is there a way to manage what comes before us?\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  There could be. From the employee perspective,  there' s not that many employees that we recognize.  Its an Employee of the Month,  at least from the general employees, right.  So that' s one employee per month,  not including Police and Fire that are recognized every month.  What we tend to do is, we usually save -  so right now we' re in the process of selecting our November,  December and January employees and we are going to bring them before you in February.  So, we usually do about three general employees per Commission meeting every four or five Commission meetings.  As to the protocols,  that all depends.  A lot of the protocols are directed by you all, right.  It' s Disability Awareness Month,  Alzheimer' s Month,  there' s a lot of different types of protocols that HR doesn' t manage,  that usually comes out of one of your offices or one of the different department' s offices.  Can we cap it?  We can cap it, but then\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I have a suggestion.  Can we identify,  just brainstorming,  identify those items that can go in the morning and perhaps have the other ones maybe at noon, split it so that we can start the day getting to work and getting to business.  Have particular identify which ones would be the morning protocols and then at 12 or 12:30 we stop for 30 minutes to do, that way at least we get the day rolling. Otherwise,  we' re all here happy to recognize,  but it really delays the ability to move the agenda.\n\nMayor Lago:  I would support that.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I also have another suggestion as well. We' ve been utilizing it and that is these time certain items. For instance,  the time that there was an 11 o' clock time certain, we paused for a moment,  because it was already 11:15, and I understand that Commissioner Fernandez was presenting at the time,  but we paused for a moment so we could take a speaker who is a businessperson, a resident of our community and allow them to speak.  So,  we as a Commission can better organize our Commission agenda by having time certains for things that people do want to come here and speak on, other than the general time that we have for public comment.  We could even put the general time for public comment as a time certain as well, so people know what time they can come in for the general public comment.  It's just a matter of scheduling.  I deal with schedules every single day when I'm dealing with courts and various people come in and any time that you ignore the overwhelming desire of the Police and Fire people to be recognized in a general meeting where everybody is there,  as opposed to just a resident showing up. And I'm not talking about whether or not this Commission shows up. I'm talking about whether residents are seeing what' s going on, then it is a second- class designation that you give to somebody when they are not in a general meeting itself,  because that' s the purpose here,  to recognize.  You don' t recognize somebody by not including them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think second class is also stating an 11 a.m. time certain,  not taking the item until 11:57. Like we did today to give preference to another item, because we had folks from the Chamber here.  We' re bordering on just choosing who we want to select as first class\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ncitizens when we are saying,  we' re going to stop the discussion on this item which everybody was listening to and we had members in the room who were here to speak on the item,  residents, because we had one person who we wanted to discuss one item on and we decided to take that item first. Again, I'm happy moving forward with this. I do not believe that any employee is going to tell you that they believe they' re second class citizens,  because we' re doing a special ceremony to recognize them and I'm happy to make a motion to move this forward.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you make your motion.  I think also what you' re not recognizing is that you mentioned that we' re not following the schedule,  we' re not keeping time certain.  We had one item that was time certain today, and the conversation ran long in regard to the school,  but let' s be also very clear. We' re also incredibly lenient, incredibly lenient on the time that we give to all residents that speak. The gentleman who spoke not once,  but two times on the same issue, which is something that we don' t have to do, spoke for probably twelve minutes,  because I was looking at one point, he had gone over by three or four minutes,  which is perfectly fine. He had spent a huge amount of time working on that presentation.  If we were to do things like other cities,  and by the way,  I think we' re the only city in Miami-Dade County that gives this much deference and this much time to talk. Some of the things I was trying to get things in line in regard to public comment, again,  not stripping public comment,  we tried that. We tried to get it in line, but we give so much time in public comment that the meetings last very, very, long, very, very long, delaying,  and then we also have case in point, we have actual debates up here, Madam City Attorney, we have debates. We just had those nice family members,  the Toyos were having a full-fist conversation with the representative for the school,  along with our staff and we were going back and forth. As you know, correct me if I'm wrong, does that happen in any other city that you are aware of?\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  I can' t say Mayor.  We are very lenient,  or I should say very flexible in public comment and extending time for members of the public to speak.\n\nMayor Lago:  Madam City Attorney,  I know that you want to be respectful as possible.  You know the answer is no. The bottom line is very simple.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It's not the answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is the answer.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not a yes or no answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is a yes or no answer,  Commissioner,  it is, because what ends up happening and I'll give you an explanation.  You know this very well because you visited many cities. What ends up happening is that they give you a public comment section at the beginning of the Commission, in the City of Miami,  Miami- Dade County,  other municipalities.  You speak about your issue and the item is presented,  and the Commission deliberates,  and we come to a conclusion.  There' s no back and forth. I've seen other cities the way they do it. I'm not saying that we do it the right way and they do it the wrong way or we do it the wrong way and they do it the right way.  I'm just\n\nsaying that we spend a lot of time giving a lot of public comments.  I think that Commissioner Menendez -  you talk about finding a middle ground,  you talk about to being on both ends of the discussion and taking a little bit from here and a little bit from here.  If you want to move forward on this, that' s fine, but why don' t we apply what Commissioner Menendez said which is, we do a little bit in the morning and we do a little bit in the afternoon,  and that way we address both issues and I'm willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning.  I think that' s perfectly fine, if you want to do it then.  I'll be willing to meet here at 8:30, it's not a precedent,  we did it under Raul, and it worked perfectly well. I never had an issue with it and the entire Commission was present,  all the employees liked it. So, I'm just telling you, meet us halfway so that we can get this done and move on to leave here by 2:30.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  Commissioner Menendez and Commissioner Fernandez,  would you be open to the idea of maybe having this first ceremony and then see what the input of the employees is, if they like it or not.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I think we' ve already done that though.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  No, no, no. The actual ceremony.  Not asking the question with however we word the survey questions,  actually having it, then being in it, and then deciding,  yes,  I like this more or no, I don' t like this more.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  That' s a pilot.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm not in favor of that.  I think it would be great to just do what Commissioner Menendez said and we move on.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I like the option that Commissioner Menendez suggested. Let' s try to organize our schedule better.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'm fine with starting earlier,  but I know there are folks that drop off their kids and that time is precious to a lot of people,  and we' re already here and staff included.  I would like the pilot to be morning and then like 12:30, see how it goes.  If we get through it fast, great,  if not, then I'm going to support a different option,  but I look to you and the administration to identify how you group them. If it was me, I would group morning certain types and afternoons time certain,  a certain time, and see if we move things forward.  I'm just - if it doesn' t work, then I'm going back to my original.\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  We can certainly look into that. I like the idea of maybe employees in the morning,  most of our employees do start at 8 in the morning.  So, we can have the employees easily here at 8 or at 8:30 in the morning,  and then maybe our standard protocols in the afternoon. We can certainly try something and if an employee works in the afternoon,  then maybe we can move that employee for the 12 o' clock slot.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago: I'm happy you mentioned that, because I was going to mention that to Commissioner Fernandez.  Our city starts at 8 o' clock in the morning,  we can start at 9 o' clock.  So, at the end of the day, the employees are here. So, to me, if we have it at 8 o' clock it's even better, because they get to work even faster.  That was one of the issues that we had when Mayor Valdes-Fauli was doing it.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I want to sweeten the pot.  Just because.  We' ve had that conversation before on another topic, maybe we can have 12:30 protocol and take a break for lunch.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s how I sweeten the pot.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There used to be a time certain 12:30 for lunch. What happened to that?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Well, that' s what I'm trying to bring back.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach hasn' t forgotten about it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I know, but that was approved,  and it just was done away with.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  If it's okay, it's not my item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That really sweetens the pot - 12:30 time certain.  My stomach approves.\n\nLaughter]\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I agree with that one.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I think I'm hypo-glycemic right now.\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we do this. Why don' t we, at the next Commission meeting,  put together something that deals with the morning and an afternoon session,  and we' ll see how that goes with the approval of the Commission through the Manager and we find a solution for that.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  So,  I guess what you' re suggesting is, at 9 a.m. we start with presentation and protocol.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  9:30 we do time certain public comment.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we go earlier. Why don' t we do 8:30? Why not?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Because there are members of staff are coming not from here, there are members of staff who live in Kendall,  who live in Homestead.  You' re affecting\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on. Hold on. Mr. Manager,  when are employees supposed to be here at work?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  At 8 o' clock.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s their job.  So,  if they are coming from Kendall or from anywhere,  they are coming,  at the end of the day, they have got to be here by 8.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I will withdraw my idea. Look, simple.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach objects.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: I know.  Sorry.  Trial run 9 a.m.  obviously we do the Pledge of Allegiance,  maybe we' re done by 9:30, 9:40, we go to Public Comments,  Time Certain 12:30, and if we' re having a good day, we have lunch right after maybe 15 minutes and we come back to wrap up. At least we have structure and I think if we' re all supportive of that structure,  it will help us make it happen.  So that' s just me. If it doesn' t work, we' ll come up with another.\n\nMayor Lago:  Is that a motion? Want to second that?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Wait. What time is the\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on a second.  Hold on. Hold on.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, because I have a question.\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I just have a question about,  what time is the second presentation protocol?\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And then lunch right after that.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Right after.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  I'll second.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, question.  Is this direction to start this next meeting or is this\u2026?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes. Yes.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  All in favor.\n\nAll: Aye.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Anyone opposed?\n\nMayor Lago:  By the way, employees will still be here at 8 o' clock though,  so we could start at 8. Moving on. Thank you, guys.",

From the numbers that were presented to me, Police was overwhelmingly in favor of moving the presentation protocols to this format;  Fire was pretty much an even split;  general employees were the ones that were in favor of keeping them here, but as the months have gone on, I think we have seen that we have residents in the room who are here to address items,  members of the community,  the Chamber,  and we continue to have lengthy presentation and protocol,  which I think would benefit from a specific forum where we are properly honoring the individuals or the organizations that are being honored in presentation and protocols,  so I wanted to bring it back and make a motion to move forward with having a specific ceremony to honor these individuals and these organizations that' s not on the Commission meetings so that we can focus our Commission meetings on Commission business.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Mayor,  if I may.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes,  go ahead.  I was going to address it. We just got an interesting email that I wanted to show you. May I Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes, I received it as well. Nadine Aleman who was here this morning.\n\nMayor Lago:  Will you put that up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: ' Good afternoon,  all: This morning, I had the honor of being present at the commission meeting to witness a proud moment: my son, Officer Michael Aleman, receiving an award.  The experience was not just a personal highlight for our family but was made extra special by the setting-a platform where his dedication and accomplishments were recognized before the public eye. The presentation and the heartfelt words spoken during the meeting added an invaluable layer of significance.\n\nIntegrating awards to our police officers into commission meetings amplifies the significance of their achievements within the broader community.  By incorporating these recognitions into such sessions,  we emphasize the importance of law enforcement in our society and showcase the commitment and sacrifices made. This is true for all our first responders and public service members.  This inclusion allows for a broader audience, from community members to local officials, to witness and appreciate the commendable work done.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nConducting these award ceremonies within commission meetings offers a powerful message of support and appreciation for our police force. It underlines the transparency and accountability of our governing bodies,  ensuring that the commendable actions of officers are acknowledged in an open and inclusive environment.  This recognition not only boosts the morale of our officers but also fosters a stronger bond between law enforcement and the community they serve,  promoting a sense of unity and mutual respect.\n\nI want to thank you for setting the stage with your continued support and inclusion of these important recognitions during commission meetings. It is an incredibly meaningful and impactful way to honor their service while fostering a deeper connection between the community and those who serve and protect it.'   I understand your point and we all can do our part on reducing the length of some of our comments,  but I read this into the record to make very,  very clear the feelings of the individuals that were here this morning and if we reflect upon the last Sunshine meeting that we were at regarding proposed change of our zoning code,  I think we had 8 or 9 individuals from the public there. It's a huge difference when you have people here that watch Commission meetings and watch reruns of Commission meetings,  they are unlikely to be watching reruns of a separate meeting at a separate time, because they are interested really in what' s happening here at our Commission every day, what is it that we' re doing.  So, I think that Mrs. Aleman' s comments adequately summarize my viewpoint on this and where I stand on it. I think it' s really important that we honor our first responders in a respectful manner and not in a separate meeting where they are less important and like second class citizens.\n\nMayor Lago: So, if I may, I want to dovetail off your comments.  I wholeheartedly agree with you. So,  this was sent to the entire Commission at 12:46 ( pm)  and it caught me off guard,  because it was very well written and she was so adamant about honoring,  about having her son honored before the Commission.  The Commission requested for a poll to be compiled and we went through the process to really understand what the residents, excuse me,  what the employees wanted, whether they are Police, Fire,  or General Employees, they are employees. What were the percentages in that number?\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  The survey was conducted by HR.\n\nDeputy City Attorney Throckmorton: I'll ask the Human Resources Director to answer those questions for you.\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  Good afternoon.  The survey was conducted back in August of last year, 2023.  So,  205 employees responded that they would like to keep the current practice of being recognized here before City Commission and 174 employees responded that they would like a separate ceremony.\n\nMayor Lago:  My point is that, listen,  it's something that works. If you look at it today,  right now it' s 2 o' clock,  we have three items left that are City Manager items that we' ll fly by them.  We' ll be out of here by 2:30. I think, again,  when you talk about the employees,  all the employees that\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nI've talked to, they like to have these meetings be present before the Commission,  and I don' t think it' s really that much of a big deal.  We went through the process to get input from the employees, they like it here, we want to move forward with that, and I think its appropriate also when you hear from parents and from individuals who are being honored before the Commission, its their moment.  Its their moment to shine,  its their moment to highlight all the great things that they do for the residents or for the business community,  and I think it just makes sense to keep it here.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I don' t think moving it diminishes the recognition and I think the Vice Mayor' s comments of calling it second class citizens is inflammatory and unnecessary.  The change is just about making sure that the focus of the Commission during Commission meetings can be focused on the needs of residents and the recognition still takes place in a forum which is specific to the recognition,  and I think the conversation that we' ve had and even Commissioner Castro added to make sure that there was some sort of reception following so that they could interact with the members of the Commission, not spend two seconds here taking a photo with a quick handshake and a photo.  I think it's a place where we could focus on the individuals and focus on those that are being recognized and making sure that they are properly recognized,  and the focus of the Commission during Commission meetings is Commission meetings. I've had several Commission meetings since August,  where the presentation and protocols have been close to an hour and forty-five minutes,  and that' s time that could have been focused on the residents who are in the room waiting for their items to be called up. In some cases,  time certain items that weren' t called up on time certain times, because we weren' t able to get to them on time, and we' ve had at least one instance where a member of the Commission was interrupted because another person had to leave the room and we wanted to make sure that they spoke.  We wouldn' t have gotten to that point had we had a specific ceremony for our employees and for the presentation and protocol and that' s the reason that I'm moving forward with this today.\n\nMayor Lago: But I think you also have to also come to terms and it' s the same situation we' ve had in the past with other decisions this Commission has made.  Let' s test the waters with the employees,  okay.  The employees still vote one way,  we' re going to vote against the employees. For example,  the same thing we were talking about the possibility of doing November elections on -  let' s do November elections,  let' s get the pulse of the community and let' s vote on it. Now we don' t want to vote on it. To me, I just think that it's - you may want that, and I understand that, but at the end of the day, the employees who are the ones being recognized are the ones saying we prefer to be in the Commission Chambers.  Honor our request.  If it was the other way around,  205 people were against it, I'd say listen,  let' s move forward with what the employee wants.  I don' t have an issue with it. It's not the first time that we changed gears on issues,  but I just think, with all due respect,  I think it's more agenda- driven than it is actually driven to benefit the employees.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  I commend you for bringing this back. Thank you very much. I thought this was a lost item. I sincerely think that the way that the survey was worded was not the best outcome, because I don' t think the words,  the questions were to really make the employees understand that this was something special for them and as far as me, I could pledge to be there every single time in any award ceremony, so that makes it any more special. I don' t know if the rest of the\n\nCommission is going to be there. I'm pretty sure most of us will be there and it will be even more special.  So, with all my heart I support this.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  My question is for the administration for the Clerk' s office,  because I think this occurred,  this issue came up because right after the elections we were having an hourand-a-half,  two-hour presentations in protocol section and it was meeting after meeting after meeting,  and we were here 9, 10, 11 hours at the end of the day, and how can -  I'm looking for solutions.  How can we better manage that situation.  Are we the only city that has protocols before the Commission meetings?  Do some have it at noon? I'm looking for something other than one or the other. Is there a hybrid? - because an hour-and- a-half, two hours which everybody is deserving, the people that are recognized,  obviously today was a perfect example,  but why are we having an hour-and-a-half to two-hour protocols when there are folks with items that we need to get to.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And to answer your question,  Commissioner,  this would still allow for certain items to come before the Commission on the date. This would not preclude us from having presentations and protocols during this meeting.  It would move so that items that are known to be at a certain time and our recognition of our employees to have a special ceremony to recognize them.  So, it is a hybrid which we worked out from the conversations that came about during our initial Commission meeting.  Originally,  the resolution that I had presented was everything would be moved to this ceremony.  This is more of a hybrid based on the input that was gathered during the Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Commissioner Menendez,  I want to give you another opportunity.  Excuse me.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You' re a little funny sometimes but continue.  Another opportunity.  Go. I'm listening.\n\nMayor Lago:  Another opportunity to kind of see it another way.  When Mayor Valdes- Fauli was here,  we used to start the Commission meeting earlier and it was seamless,  and it wasn' t an issue. We had it downstairs.  I think people enjoyed it. It wasn' t an issue. We started 30-45 minutes early. We got here probably at 9:15 and we moved forward pretty quickly.  For some reason I thought that maybe being outside pushed the protocol documents faster,  maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like it was kind of a much faster process.  I said,  let' s get here earlier and let' s get it done.  I'm more than willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning,  at 8:30, get it done,  and we meet the goals of the employees who they stated very clearly by the poll that we took that they would rather have it here and we meet the goal of getting here as quickly as possible and the residents can get here at 9 o' clock, 9:15, to have their items heard in a timely manner without any delays from the protocol section of the meeting.  Does that opportunity work for you?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s definitely one option.  I know we discussed that when this first came up.  Other than presentations and obviously the recognition,  Employee of the Month,  its September so we' re recognizing, is there a way to manage how many protocol items are per Commission meeting?  Can we cap it a little bit better because if you look at it, there are months\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nthat we have an hour-and-a-half, two hours, and then there are other meetings that we have, we' re done in 40 minutes or 35 minutes.  Is there a way to manage what comes before us?\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  There could be. From the employee perspective,  there' s not that many employees that we recognize.  Its an Employee of the Month,  at least from the general employees, right.  So that' s one employee per month,  not including Police and Fire that are recognized every month.  What we tend to do is, we usually save -  so right now we' re in the process of selecting our November,  December and January employees and we are going to bring them before you in February.  So, we usually do about three general employees per Commission meeting every four or five Commission meetings.  As to the protocols,  that all depends.  A lot of the protocols are directed by you all, right.  It' s Disability Awareness Month,  Alzheimer' s Month,  there' s a lot of different types of protocols that HR doesn' t manage,  that usually comes out of one of your offices or one of the different department' s offices.  Can we cap it?  We can cap it, but then\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I have a suggestion.  Can we identify,  just brainstorming,  identify those items that can go in the morning and perhaps have the other ones maybe at noon, split it so that we can start the day getting to work and getting to business.  Have particular identify which ones would be the morning protocols and then at 12 or 12:30 we stop for 30 minutes to do, that way at least we get the day rolling. Otherwise,  we' re all here happy to recognize,  but it really delays the ability to move the agenda.\n\nMayor Lago:  I would support that.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I also have another suggestion as well. We' ve been utilizing it and that is these time certain items. For instance,  the time that there was an 11 o' clock time certain, we paused for a moment,  because it was already 11:15, and I understand that Commissioner Fernandez was presenting at the time,  but we paused for a moment so we could take a speaker who is a businessperson, a resident of our community and allow them to speak.  So,  we as a Commission can better organize our Commission agenda by having time certains for things that people do want to come here and speak on, other than the general time that we have for public comment.  We could even put the general time for public comment as a time certain as well, so people know what time they can come in for the general public comment.  It's just a matter of scheduling.  I deal with schedules every single day when I'm dealing with courts and various people come in and any time that you ignore the overwhelming desire of the Police and Fire people to be recognized in a general meeting where everybody is there,  as opposed to just a resident showing up. And I'm not talking about whether or not this Commission shows up. I'm talking about whether residents are seeing what' s going on, then it is a second- class designation that you give to somebody when they are not in a general meeting itself,  because that' s the purpose here,  to recognize.  You don' t recognize somebody by not including them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think second class is also stating an 11 a.m. time certain,  not taking the item until 11:57. Like we did today to give preference to another item, because we had folks from the Chamber here.  We' re bordering on just choosing who we want to select as first class\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ncitizens when we are saying,  we' re going to stop the discussion on this item which everybody was listening to and we had members in the room who were here to speak on the item,  residents, because we had one person who we wanted to discuss one item on and we decided to take that item first. Again, I'm happy moving forward with this. I do not believe that any employee is going to tell you that they believe they' re second class citizens,  because we' re doing a special ceremony to recognize them and I'm happy to make a motion to move this forward.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you make your motion.  I think also what you' re not recognizing is that you mentioned that we' re not following the schedule,  we' re not keeping time certain.  We had one item that was time certain today, and the conversation ran long in regard to the school,  but let' s be also very clear. We' re also incredibly lenient, incredibly lenient on the time that we give to all residents that speak. The gentleman who spoke not once,  but two times on the same issue, which is something that we don' t have to do, spoke for probably twelve minutes,  because I was looking at one point, he had gone over by three or four minutes,  which is perfectly fine. He had spent a huge amount of time working on that presentation.  If we were to do things like other cities,  and by the way,  I think we' re the only city in Miami-Dade County that gives this much deference and this much time to talk. Some of the things I was trying to get things in line in regard to public comment, again,  not stripping public comment,  we tried that. We tried to get it in line, but we give so much time in public comment that the meetings last very, very, long, very, very long, delaying,  and then we also have case in point, we have actual debates up here, Madam City Attorney, we have debates. We just had those nice family members,  the Toyos were having a full-fist conversation with the representative for the school,  along with our staff and we were going back and forth. As you know, correct me if I'm wrong, does that happen in any other city that you are aware of?\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  I can' t say Mayor.  We are very lenient,  or I should say very flexible in public comment and extending time for members of the public to speak.\n\nMayor Lago:  Madam City Attorney,  I know that you want to be respectful as possible.  You know the answer is no. The bottom line is very simple.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It's not the answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is the answer.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not a yes or no answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is a yes or no answer,  Commissioner,  it is, because what ends up happening and I'll give you an explanation.  You know this very well because you visited many cities. What ends up happening is that they give you a public comment section at the beginning of the Commission, in the City of Miami,  Miami- Dade County,  other municipalities.  You speak about your issue and the item is presented,  and the Commission deliberates,  and we come to a conclusion.  There' s no back and forth. I've seen other cities the way they do it. I'm not saying that we do it the right way and they do it the wrong way or we do it the wrong way and they do it the right way.  I'm just\n\nsaying that we spend a lot of time giving a lot of public comments.  I think that Commissioner Menendez -  you talk about finding a middle ground,  you talk about to being on both ends of the discussion and taking a little bit from here and a little bit from here.  If you want to move forward on this, that' s fine, but why don' t we apply what Commissioner Menendez said which is, we do a little bit in the morning and we do a little bit in the afternoon,  and that way we address both issues and I'm willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning.  I think that' s perfectly fine, if you want to do it then.  I'll be willing to meet here at 8:30, it's not a precedent,  we did it under Raul, and it worked perfectly well. I never had an issue with it and the entire Commission was present,  all the employees liked it. So, I'm just telling you, meet us halfway so that we can get this done and move on to leave here by 2:30.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  Commissioner Menendez and Commissioner Fernandez,  would you be open to the idea of maybe having this first ceremony and then see what the input of the employees is, if they like it or not.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I think we' ve already done that though.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  No, no, no. The actual ceremony.  Not asking the question with however we word the survey questions,  actually having it, then being in it, and then deciding,  yes,  I like this more or no, I don' t like this more.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  That' s a pilot.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm not in favor of that.  I think it would be great to just do what Commissioner Menendez said and we move on.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I like the option that Commissioner Menendez suggested. Let' s try to organize our schedule better.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'm fine with starting earlier,  but I know there are folks that drop off their kids and that time is precious to a lot of people,  and we' re already here and staff included.  I would like the pilot to be morning and then like 12:30, see how it goes.  If we get through it fast, great,  if not, then I'm going to support a different option,  but I look to you and the administration to identify how you group them. If it was me, I would group morning certain types and afternoons time certain,  a certain time, and see if we move things forward.  I'm just - if it doesn' t work, then I'm going back to my original.\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  We can certainly look into that. I like the idea of maybe employees in the morning,  most of our employees do start at 8 in the morning.  So, we can have the employees easily here at 8 or at 8:30 in the morning,  and then maybe our standard protocols in the afternoon. We can certainly try something and if an employee works in the afternoon,  then maybe we can move that employee for the 12 o' clock slot.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago: I'm happy you mentioned that, because I was going to mention that to Commissioner Fernandez.  Our city starts at 8 o' clock in the morning,  we can start at 9 o' clock.  So, at the end of the day, the employees are here. So, to me, if we have it at 8 o' clock it's even better, because they get to work even faster.  That was one of the issues that we had when Mayor Valdes-Fauli was doing it.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I want to sweeten the pot.  Just because.  We' ve had that conversation before on another topic, maybe we can have 12:30 protocol and take a break for lunch.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s how I sweeten the pot.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There used to be a time certain 12:30 for lunch. What happened to that?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Well, that' s what I'm trying to bring back.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach hasn' t forgotten about it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I know, but that was approved,  and it just was done away with.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  If it's okay, it's not my item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That really sweetens the pot - 12:30 time certain.  My stomach approves.\n\nLaughter]\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I agree with that one.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I think I'm hypo-glycemic right now.\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we do this. Why don' t we, at the next Commission meeting,  put together something that deals with the morning and an afternoon session,  and we' ll see how that goes with the approval of the Commission through the Manager and we find a solution for that.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  So,  I guess what you' re suggesting is, at 9 a.m. we start with presentation and protocol.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  9:30 we do time certain public comment.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we go earlier. Why don' t we do 8:30? Why not?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Because there are members of staff are coming not from here, there are members of staff who live in Kendall,  who live in Homestead.  You' re affecting\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on. Hold on. Mr. Manager,  when are employees supposed to be here at work?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  At 8 o' clock.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s their job.  So,  if they are coming from Kendall or from anywhere,  they are coming,  at the end of the day, they have got to be here by 8.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I will withdraw my idea. Look, simple.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach objects.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: I know.  Sorry.  Trial run 9 a.m.  obviously we do the Pledge of Allegiance,  maybe we' re done by 9:30, 9:40, we go to Public Comments,  Time Certain 12:30, and if we' re having a good day, we have lunch right after maybe 15 minutes and we come back to wrap up. At least we have structure and I think if we' re all supportive of that structure,  it will help us make it happen.  So that' s just me. If it doesn' t work, we' ll come up with another.\n\nMayor Lago:  Is that a motion? Want to second that?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Wait. What time is the\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on a second.  Hold on. Hold on.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, because I have a question.\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I just have a question about,  what time is the second presentation protocol?\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And then lunch right after that.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Right after.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  I'll second.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, question.  Is this direction to start this next meeting or is this\u2026?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes. Yes.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  All in favor.\n\nAll: Aye.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Anyone opposed?\n\nMayor Lago:  By the way, employees will still be here at 8 o' clock though,  so we could start at 8. Moving on. Thank you, guys.",

( Sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez)\n\nMayor Lago:  Moving onto E-7.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez: E-7 is an Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code, Creating Section 5-314 ' Window and Hurricane Shutters' to regulate the closure of window and hurricane shutters and amending the City Code, Chapter 1-General Provisions,  Section 1-7 entitled ' Penalties'  to provide a penalty for the closure of window and hurricane shutters outside of the hurricane season;  providing for severability clause,\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nrepealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date. This is a public hearing item. Assistant City Attorney Gus Ceballos will present the ordinance.\n\nMayor Lago: May I ask you a quick question Mr. City Attorney,  because I know I've had residents call me before or send an email in regard to code enforcement issues,  their neighbors have their windows closed,  shutters.  How have we addressed this before with Code Enforcement when those individuals have been turned into Code Enforcement.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Ceballos:  Typically,  Code Enforcement will go out and our code doesn' t prohibit the closure of the shutters.  There are other parts of our city code that may apply to abandoned property,  if you have all the windows shuddered.  There are other characteristics to get the meat in order to fall under that definition of an abandoned property and that' s a different enforcement mechanism. This creates a simpler enforcement mechanism specifically for the purpose of shutters.  We know it happens all the time. People put them up and then the next thing you know its February and people still have their shutters up. Frankly, for whatever reason whether its laziness or they just haven' t had the chance or the time, this is an enforcement mechanism that will address that particular item independent of all the other issues with an abandoned property.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, what they do is, they basically have a conversation with the property owner and speak to them about opening up their windows.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  May I say something.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Its also a building code issue,  because you need ventilation,  and you need egress.\n\nMayor Lago:  Of course.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  So, you' ve got two building code issues where you have an unsafe structure at that point.\n\nMayor Lago:  But my question was, how would we address it, because I know that residents have sent us emails over the years saying listen,  my neighbor doesn' t have one window open in their house,  its all shuddered,  how have we addressed that.  I've even had it on the garage,  and they' ve complied through Code Enforcement.  How did we get it done before?\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Ceballos:  So, I personally have never had to deal with that particular issue before. What I can do is I can find out from Code Enforcement how they' ve handled it in the past.  I can let you know. I can look into it for you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Isn' t it also a fire code issue?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Just to give - that' s one of my major concerns and the reason that I'm putting this in here.  I know that it is a major fire issue.  I've driven through parts of North Gables where you have homes that have shutters on every single opening that' s visible from the street.  I also think we are trying to keep a look for our city, we go through this lengthy approval process to make sure that homes look good and look appropriate for Code Enforcement,  and this is one thing. I understand during hurricane season sometimes you have that first storm that comes up, you put up your shutters,  and it is cumbersome and difficult to remove them.  We have folks who don' t necessarily have the ability to do it themselves and have to rely on family members.  So,  what I wanted to do was give a buffer so that you have through the end of hurricane season and possibly a storm that lingers after hurricane season and give a two-week cushion after that last storm or after the end of hurricane season for folks to take them down.  I think after hurricane seasons complete those shutters should be taken down for the reasons that have been addressed.\n\nMayor Lago:  Any public comment,  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have a question.  I don' t see a warning procedure in here. Most things that we deal with, and this is not a life - we usually have a warning procedure.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, this isn' t sending a specific enforcement mechanism in this ordinance. It would revert to our standard,  which is we can always issue a warning.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Some of these -  I can understand why there' s not a warning on some of the items here listed, but I would like a warning.  Homeowners Association always tells somebody you have 30-35 days to take them down otherwise XYZ penalty will be imposed.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm willing to bet that when you think about it, the person who probably has their shutters up for a long time is an elderly person.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  Who paid somebody to put their shutters up or a daughter or son to go and put their shutters up,  they don' t live in Miami- Dade County or they do, but they are busy with their own\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nlives and they haven' t been able to get to it, because its an endeavor and you are talking about somebody you hit them with another $ 500 fine right off the bat, its tough, you know, and then we get the call and its like, you know how it works, its like we send it to you and show leniency,  this person is 90 years old, what do we do.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Miami Lakes had the same sort of thing, and I was the shutter- installer,  so I had to make time.\n\nMayor Lago:  Or the person is disabled,  good example.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not an easy process.  I've done it and it's not fun.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No, no, its not fun, that' s why I think at least 30 days.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.  I thought there was a provision that we would fall back on, that was my understanding.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, a Code Enforcement Officer always has the ability to issue a warning before enforcement. If the Commission wants to mandate in this particular regulation that a warning must be issued first, we can certainly incorporate that into it.\n\nMayor Lago:  If the sponsor would allow me. I would want to make sure that that' s memorialized because at the end of the day,  I'm pretty sure we' re dealing with elderly people,  older people, disabled people who, I don' t think anybody wants to live in their house completely shuddered like that, you don' t see any sunlight.  I don' t think it' s a very pleasant situation.  So, I think those people probably need to be pushed or helped in one way or another to get those shutters off.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'd be happy to amend it to add a 30-day warning as the first course of action from the city.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Mr. Clerk, do we have any public comment?\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'll entertain a motion.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Move.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Second.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes Commissioner Castro:  Yes\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Yes Commissioner Menendez:  Yes Mayor Lago:  Yes Vote: 5-0)\n\nAssistant City Attorney\n\nCeballos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Thank you.",

( Sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez)\n\nMayor Lago:  Moving onto E-7.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez: E-7 is an Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code, Creating Section 5-314 ' Window and Hurricane Shutters' to regulate the closure of window and hurricane shutters and amending the City Code, Chapter 1-General Provisions,  Section 1-7 entitled ' Penalties'  to provide a penalty for the closure of window and hurricane shutters outside of the hurricane season;  providing for severability clause,\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nrepealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date. This is a public hearing item. Assistant City Attorney Gus Ceballos will present the ordinance.\n\nMayor Lago: May I ask you a quick question Mr. City Attorney,  because I know I've had residents call me before or send an email in regard to code enforcement issues,  their neighbors have their windows closed,  shutters.  How have we addressed this before with Code Enforcement when those individuals have been turned into Code Enforcement.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Ceballos:  Typically,  Code Enforcement will go out and our code doesn' t prohibit the closure of the shutters.  There are other parts of our city code that may apply to abandoned property,  if you have all the windows shuddered.  There are other characteristics to get the meat in order to fall under that definition of an abandoned property and that' s a different enforcement mechanism. This creates a simpler enforcement mechanism specifically for the purpose of shutters.  We know it happens all the time. People put them up and then the next thing you know its February and people still have their shutters up. Frankly, for whatever reason whether its laziness or they just haven' t had the chance or the time, this is an enforcement mechanism that will address that particular item independent of all the other issues with an abandoned property.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, what they do is, they basically have a conversation with the property owner and speak to them about opening up their windows.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  May I say something.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Its also a building code issue,  because you need ventilation,  and you need egress.\n\nMayor Lago:  Of course.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  So, you' ve got two building code issues where you have an unsafe structure at that point.\n\nMayor Lago:  But my question was, how would we address it, because I know that residents have sent us emails over the years saying listen,  my neighbor doesn' t have one window open in their house,  its all shuddered,  how have we addressed that.  I've even had it on the garage,  and they' ve complied through Code Enforcement.  How did we get it done before?\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Ceballos:  So, I personally have never had to deal with that particular issue before. What I can do is I can find out from Code Enforcement how they' ve handled it in the past.  I can let you know. I can look into it for you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Isn' t it also a fire code issue?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Just to give - that' s one of my major concerns and the reason that I'm putting this in here.  I know that it is a major fire issue.  I've driven through parts of North Gables where you have homes that have shutters on every single opening that' s visible from the street.

This is a quasi- judicial item so anyone who will be testifying today should be sworn in by the City Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  For those who will be appearing on this item, please stand and raise your right hand.  Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you' ll provide today will be the truth and nothing but the truth?\n\n## COMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   Ms. Russo,  good morning.\n\nLaura Russo:  Good morning,  Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Commission.   My name is Laura Russo with offices at 2334 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, and I am here this morning representing St.  Philip' s Episcopal Church and School. I have with me Reverend Mary Beth Conroy,  Ed Diaz,  who is Chief Operations Officer,  Norma Diaz,  who is Head of School,  also supporting us is Sissy Slesnick,  who is a parishioner,  Octavio Santurio,  who is the architect of the project.   I'll give you a little bit of background.   St. Philip' s has been in the City of Coral Gables as a church for 80 years.   The school has been in existence for 70 years.   For those of you who don' t know the exact location,  it is located on the block that is bounded by Coral Way to the north, Andalusia to the south,  Columbus to the west,  and Cordova to the east. Back in 2001 through 2003,  St. Philip' s underwent a master plan process.   And in that process,  it was proposing a new building,  but during that process,  it underwent a total review of its operations.   Conditions were imposed,  limiting the number of students,  setting up the drop-off operation,  legislating certain landscaping,  making sure that any changes to a site plan would go before a public hearing process, making decisions with respect to colors of the building so that the school would blend into the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential neighborhood,  parking for employees in the lot to the east of Salvadore Park,  and also dealing with special event permits for the special events that were held either by the school or by the church.   Again, to put it into a geographic location,  the school is located immediately north of Salvadore Park that as you know has a whole playground section,  tennis courts, a pickleball court, the little parking lot to the east and a dog park now. The request that we are making today is to demolish an existing building that sits at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia and replace it with another building.   The idea is -- well, the reason for it is the building was old, had sagging floors and had a lot of issues and it made more sense to demolish the building and build a new one.   The new structure will be approximately the same size.   It will house the same two classrooms,  Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, a multi-purpose room and storage area.  The difference in the square footage is that there is now a covered walkway that is a canopy and it's an awning and that,  for security purposes,  will be enclosed and it will connect to another building on the campus.   Let' s see,  the Board of Architects has approved the new building. We went twice to the Board of Architects.   They wanted windows on the eastern side of the new building.   One of the conditions that was imposed in the 2001-2003 master plan would be that no building would have any windows on the eastern side.  Board of Architects insisted that it would look too institutional,  which is what we were trying to avoid,  and so they asked that we change that condition and the windows are fixed and operable windows.   They' re meant for an aesthetic purpose,  not to function.   They are actually on the portion of the building that' s closest to the front, which is adjacent to the driveway and garage of the adjacent neighbor to the east of us.   The balance of the building,  which is in back,  which would face the single- family neighbor to the right is solid and there' s extensive landscaping that' s several feet wide that was put in back in 2003 as part of the condition for the original site plan. We appeared before the Planning and Zoning Board. Staff recommended approval with three conditions,  that the windows remain fixed and inoperative,  that we keep every other condition,  including the limitation on the number of children,  and that we heavily landscape the front part of this building.  During COVID, the front part of this building was graveled in order to facilitate the drop-off when we first started going back to school.  And so it has remained gravel. That gravel will be removed after construction and that area in front of this will be heavily landscaped.   So, right now the drop-off is set up.  There is a drop-off for the older grades.   Third, fourth,  and fifth grade are dropped off in front of the school.   Four parking spaces are coned off and the parents come in going east to west so that the children can be dropped off on the sidewalk side and not on the street side.   And a neighbor that -who is here as well has appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and an additional condition was added to the approval. And the condition was that the church landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia. And so we' re here to respectfully request that we keep the conditions that were imposed by staff and eliminate that condition and I'd like to explain why.   First of all, those are not adjacent neighbors.   Those four properties,  one of them happens to belong to the church,  the one on the corner of --  the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova belongs to St. Philip' s. The other three are not adjacent, meaning they don' t abut the school property. We are not proposing an increase in students,  so we are not making a bigger impact.   The same number of students,  180, have gone to this school since 2001.  We are in an area where the increased activity and need for parking has come from the beautiful playground equipment that now adorns\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nSalvadore Park.   Having used it as a mother,  it's a vast improvement from what it was 30-some years ago.   There is also,  as you know, very active use of the tennis courts,  starting from early in the morning now that one of the courts has been designated a pickleball court,  one of the most popular sports in in the country.   And you also now have a dog park.  So, it is a neighborhood that has a lot of activity.   The school is there 172 days out of 365.   Yes,  the church does have its activities,  but I would submit to you that the school is not the only reason why there' s an issue with parking.   And I think it' s not fair to penalize the nonprofit school and institution that lives there,  but rather we should try to work as a community,  both the City and the church and school, to see if we can find a way to alleviate the parking on swales.   I brought --  because I want you to know the school tries very hard to make sure that parents don' t park in the swale.   That doesn' t mean they don' t, but they try very hard.   And I just brought two samples of newsletters.   So, this newsletter is published monthly,  and it goes out to all the school parents,  and I highlighted -there' s a whole section on parking.   I'm going to pass these around.   So,  it's not something that they say once at the beginning of the school year during orientation and just say,  okay,  we hope you guys pay attention to it.  No, they' re reminded on a regular basis,  and I can tell you that the Ed Diaz,  who' s chief of operations,  has been called by nearby residents to ask parents to,  you know,  leave the driveway or whatever. So,  we' re well aware of it and we try working hard to prevent it from happening.   But I think the burden of landscaping and maintaining non-adjacent neighbors is just -seems more like a penalty to a school. If I were asking for an increase in students,  I would say,  yeah,  of course,  because we' re going to now have a bigger impact on the community.   We' re bringing more cars to the area with more students.   But we still have the same students,  the same number of students for the last 22 years.   So, let me pass this around.\n\nCommissioner Castro: Since this is a quasi- judicial item,  I would like to disclose that I have received emails regarding this item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I've received emails as well.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Same here, so have I.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think everybody has,  so moving on.\n\nMs. Russo:  Alright,  so I respectfully request that you approve the proposal for the new building along with the staff-imposed conditions and eliminate the condition of landscaping the properties between Coral Way and Andalusia on Cordova.  And we' re here to answer any questions you may have, and I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal,  if necessary.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Director,  how are you?\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Good,  thank you.   Good morning,  Jennifer Garcia,  Planning Official.  If I could have the PowerPoint,  please.  Okay,  so we' re here for a major amendment to the approved 2002 site plan for St. Philip' s School.   As indicated,  this site is south of Coral Way to the east of\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nColumbus,  north of Andalusia,  and to just west of Cordova.  This is an aerial of the campus.  We' re talking about just the southeast portion of the campus,  which is now an existing house typology which was converted into a preschool.   So, the future land use designation is religious institutional use.   The zoning is special use.   So,  the Ordinance Number 3576 is what approved the site plan. And then there' s conditions regarding any changes to the site plan would have to require Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission review and approval,  as well as the no openings on the east fa\u00e7ade. So,  again,  we' re talking about the southeast portion of the site and looking at the proposed building,  it would have classrooms one and two for preschool on the front, the back-ofhouse equipment is located west of the building away from the single- family adjacent house, restored swale on the front of the structure of the proposed preschool building,  a front yard.   The storage is going to be acting as a buffer between the existing home to the east and the actual preschool area,  and in the back is a multi-purpose room and playground.   Here' s a rendering of what that looks like.  Again,  this was approved by the Board of Architects.   It went to DRC back in April of last year.   Board of Architects,  a couple of times, and approval in August.   They had a neighborhood meeting in October. Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval in November,  and here we are for first reading at City Commission.   So, the letters were sent to the property within a thousand feet as required by code,  and that happened three times so far.  It was posted twice,  three times website posting and once for newspaper advertisements. So,  staff has determined that it' s consistent with the comp plan and it complies with all the findings of fact, which is part of your packet and the staff report today.   So,  there' s two conditions of approval. The first one is the non-operable fixed windows on the fa\u00e7ade facing the adjacent abutting neighbor to the east.   The swale improvements on the front, and as she indicated,  the Planning and Zoning Board wanted to expand that and have it on Cordova as well between Coral Way and Andalusia to prevent parking and other issues that the school,  I guess,  has been dealing with for quite some time.  And all the conditions that are listed in Ordinance Number 3576 would still remain in effect. That' s it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Thank you.\n\nMs. Russo:  And if you want to see, I have a little PowerPoint that just shows you a little bit, if we can get it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Perfect,  thank you.\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Could we get the applicant PowerPoint,  please?  Press the big button.\n\nMs. Russo:  Next slide.   Alright,  this is the existing building,  so this is the building that' s being replaced,  the one again on the southeast corner of the campus.   This is the new proposed building. This is the area behind the school,  behind that particular building.   And this is existing.   And you can see there is a -- this particular house had an old detached garage that actually sat on the property\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nline.  So, one of the requirements of the original site plan is if this building ever came down, that garage that' s on the property line would have to be removed and needless to say, all setbacks would have to be observed.   This is what the back will look at.  It will now be set back from the neighbor to the east. And again,  the building that you see without the arches is the one that faces the neighbor and that has the blank wall.   The building with the arches is the one that will have the fixed inoperable windows near the front. This is what the space will look like. This is the multipurpose space.   I'm sorry, the other were the classrooms.   This is the multipurpose space that will also be able to work so that activities,  depending on weather,  as you can see,  it opens up to the backyard.   And that' s it.   I just wanted you to get a little glimpse of what we' re doing.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Mr. Mayor, we have several members of the public requesting to speak on this item.  The first is Norma Perez.\n\nMs. Russo:   She' s decided not to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Okay.\n\nMs. Russo:   They just signed in in case they wanted to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Edward Diaz.  Mary Conroy.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nMary Conroy:   Hi, I'm Mary Beth Conroy.   I'm the rector of St. Philip' s.   I've been here for 14 years.   And when I moved here,  I thought I had a great vocabulary,  but I did not know the word swale.   And so,  I've learned something about it.  And thanks to my friendly parishioners,  they taught me that I was to maintain my swale and that it did not belong to me.   And so,  for all the many years I've lived here,  I have replanted my swale,  like I'm sure many of you have.   I've endured neighbors doing construction projects joyfully,  and I'm happy to be in a community that works together so that we can live together in harmony. I will say that St.  Philip' s is in a neighborhood that' s in high demand for parking and we struggle with the same issues that our neighbors do and those who want to attend and use the glorious park that has been provided by the City.   It has only increased and become more challenging. And as Ms. Russo pointed out,  we continue to ask people to rideshare when we have big events,  whether it's a large funeral,  whether it' s a big event for the school.   We ask people to observe ' No Parking'  signs, to be mindful of the neighbors' driveways for their own safety.   And we try in every way we can to be a good and gracious neighbor.   And we' re happy to work with the City and with all of our neighbors and all the constituents to try to find reasonable solutions.   But I strongly believe that asking St. Philip' s\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nto take on in perpetuity to plant and maintain a non-adjacent neighbor swale is not only unfair, it's unneighborly. And so,  we' re here to really ask your permission to build a new building for our youngest learners.   And I hope you will support us.   Thank you.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Octavio\n\nSanturio.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, he' s --  no.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Cecilia Slesnick.\n\nCecelia Slesnick:   Good morning,  Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, Commissioners,  everyone on the dais. Cecilia Slesnick,  721 Navarre,  Coral Gables,  and many Coral Gables addresses before that.   As nearly a 23-year-long parishioner of St. Philip' s and a lifelong resident of the City of Coral Gables, I know the issue of parking.   I know the issue of swale,  a word which,  by the way, is constantly autocorrected if you' ve ever tried to spell it.   And I know how special our church community is at St.  Philip' s.   So,  as a parishioner,  I understand the challenges. As Ms. Russo pointed out,  the enrollment at the school is not going to be increasing.   And as you saw by the picture,  actually I think aesthetically it' s going to be a nice improvement to the block and will make it all feel much more cohesive,  which I appreciate as a realtor.   The second thing, as was noted,  is that the swales are public property.   And I remind that to my neighbors in my neighborhood.   And as I'm selling homes in Coral Gables,  I remind the homeowners that the swales are to be kept by you, but they are public property.   So, that' s where your visitors should park when they come to see you.  If you have deliveries,  if you have people coming to work at your home, that' s where they should park. They should not be blocking the sidewalks,  and they certainly shouldn' t be blocking --  parking in the streets like you do in other municipalities.   So, as a nonprofit,  as a church community,  which I know many of you on the dais can appreciate as churchgoers,  and all of you go to churches in this vicinity,  you can understand that it feels a little unfair.   Public parking is a bigger issue,  right? Especially on the footprint that we' re looking at.  The most welcome improvements to Salvadore Park.   Speaking as someone who swung on those rusty swings in the 1980s, and if you did, you' ll remember that they swayed a lot and it was really fun to see how high up you could go and not land in a tennis court.  So, the improvements are welcome.   My children love them.  Every Sunday when I park to go to church,  I hear the ping and the pong of the pickleballs and the tennis courts, and my golden retriever has loved the dog park.  So, all of these improvements bring not only joy and excitement to the City, but obviously,  it creates a little bit of congestion that everyone in the neighborhood has to work with, right?  The neighbors on Venetia,  the neighbors on Columbus,  all of the neighbors have to.  So, although I'm not speaking on behalf of the School and Community Relations Committee,  you all know that I am a member of the School and Community Relations Committee,  right?  SCRC,  School and Community Relations Committee.   And I'm not speaking on their behalf,  but because I'm a member and have been,  I know that every school in our community has its challenges with our ever-growing,  ever-evolving,  and ever-brightening city. So, let' s just keep that in mind as we go through this first reading and we move on to the second reading that every decision that' s made in and around schools potentially sets a precedent for all\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nof the other schools,  right?  For your children at St. Teresa,  for the children at ECC, to all the way to the children at Ponce and Gables and Gables Prep and et cetera,  et cetera,  et cetera.   So, thank you all so much.  And I hope to see you all at the Beaux Arts Festival this weekend.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Sorry, I won' t be able to make it.   I'll be in Montana.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   J. C. Toyos.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Toyos.  Good morning.\n\nJ. C. Toyos:  Good morning,  J. C. Toyos,  1044 Coral Way.\n\nWaldo Toyos:   Waldo Toyos, 1044 Coral Way.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And we' re here to speak against what they' re talking about.   I mean,  I'm shocked at the fact that you decided not to do what the Planning and Zoning Committee recommended in order to help the problems that we' re having with parking.   But aside from that,  we had sent an email to you guys because we have, looking into this issue,  found some other issues that we' d like to address that are important not just to me and my family, but to our community as a whole.  First, we would have really appreciated for them to reach out to us to let us know that they were no longer planning on doing what they said they were going to do.   So, it was kind of shocking for me to hear now that what they --  we thought were going to do as far as the parking situation to help alleviate it,  they' re not even going to do that.  And I've also been a part of the community for over 30 some odd years,  and he was born here.   So,  he also went to Salvadore Park,  and he was also coming to the area,  and we also have five children that are -  that were raised there.   So,  we know the community really well.   So,  this is also our family that is being impacted,  not just by what they' re planning on doing, but their future families,  if God bless,  they decide to stay in Coral Gables.   So, the first thing is the landscape.   I can' t believe you guys backed out of that.   I think it' s unconscionable to do so.  I do think that the reason that we' re having parking issues is because of the parents in the school.   And the reason for that is because it' s during the time periods that you guys are picking up your children and the children are being dropped off.  So, I do think it's a responsibility that the school bears,  and I do think that you guys should take care of it.  Second, what we found during some research is that the school' s growing.   They' re saying that they' re capped,  and they' re saying that they' re keeping their covenant. I couldn' t find the covenant to review it.   So, I haven' t\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   I have a copy.  The covenant is recorded in the public records of Miami- Dade County.\n\nMs. Toyos:  They' re growing.   And not only are they growing by square footage,  they' re growing in acquiring homes right across from my house.   They bought the house right across from us, and they' re using it for their school activities.   So,  I think that the covenant has been broken,  simply because if they were originally just going to be a school with their original homes and the original\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nsquare footage that they have,  their square footage is already grown with the new addition and changes they' ve made.   And if you look at the plot lines of the lots, they' ve encroached on them. In other words,  one lot encroaches on another lot, and then they expand on that classroom.   And then when they bought the house across the street from us, I don' t know what you guys are using it for, I'd like to know because they do have a lot of activity going on in there,  and a lot of kids and parents coming in and out.  So, there are questions that were brought to my mind that weren' t there before because of this issue.   And if they are going to make an amendment to the covenant, I would like some things changed to that covenant going forward in order for this to be approved. Okay, baby, your turn.\n\nMr. Toyos:   I think that,  how do you call it, first of all, this thing about the --  what the Planning and Zoning Board,  it wasn' t us who asked for the swale improvement. It was the Planning and Zoning Board that said,  hey, you, you guys, this is on you.   It wasn' t us asking the Planning and Zoning Board.   We just went up there and,  how do you call it, said we have a traffic problem. They' re blocking our driveways.   Yeah,  I mean,  and this happens,  how do you call it, constantly. And I keep on hearing it's the Salvadore Park, people who come to Salvadore Park,  the dog park, the pickleballers.   I don' t see people with pickleball rackets coming down, you know, blocking our driveways or doing that.  We' re trying to just keep our swales like any normal one.  Yes, we have normal use of swale,  delivery guys,  postal service,  whatever. But at least with that,  we could maintain our grass.   We can' t maintain our grass.   Their side looks like a desert,  okay, on Cordova side.\n\nMs. Toyos:  ( INAUDIBLE)  the pictures?\n\nMr.  Toyos: One of our neighbors behind them has had his swale with,  how do you call it, landscaping now for, as long as I can remember.   You know, we' ve owned that property for over 20 years. They' ve had it for much more than that,  so they' ve dealt with it.   Our backdoor neighbors,  Mary and --  this is what it looks like.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is what the neighbors do to our sidewalks.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And this is what the other neighbors have to do to make sure that they don' t block them when the pickup and drop-off (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is barricades put up by, I guess,  the City.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:   The signs are being used to help the --  the signs alone are not enough.   This is what they' ve used to keep the people off the corner so that the intersection visibility doesn' t get blocked.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Toyos:   Sometimes I can' t get out of my house because people are blocking my entrance and exit.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Backdoor neighbor,  she had to put it because her driveway' s in the front, so Andalusia, corner of Andalusia,  and right behind us,  and -on Cordova,  they had to put landscape in their front.  Now their side is still barren.   They can' t do anything.   It's --  I mean,  we can' t maintain our grass.   And it's not the people using the dog park.   It's not the people using the pickleball courts or tennis courts.  It's parents.   And we reached out to the pastor,  with all due respect,  in 2022.  We went in and we sat with her.  Nothing' s come from it.  Nothing.   The Planning and Zoning asked them,  hey, reach out to the neighbor.   Just try to take care of their situation.\n\nMs. Toyos:   They didn' t reach out.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Nothing.   We' ve tried to be neighborly. And to say that we' re not --  asking is not neighborly,  no, it was the Planning and Zoning Board.   All of them agreed that, hey, this is on you guys.   This is not on them.   So, we just want a solution,  but we also want to know --  there' s two issues here.   They bought that house in 2016 and now has an exemption.   So, they' re paying $ 67. So, I imagine that they' re having a school and it says an educational exemption on that property in the corner right across from us.  And by the way, we' re only 130 feet.  We might not be adjacent, but our radius,  we' re 130 feet from their closest property line, their campus property line.  So,  if they' re there and they' re claiming that exemption,  what' s the use of this property?   Because this is what' s causing the issues. If they' re going to keep on buying single- family homes and converting them over into school space,  it defeats the purpose.   They have no parking.   They have zero parking.   This should have been done with 30, 40 years ago when they expanded or they did this amendment and all that stuff.  This should have taken place because they just didn' t have the parking.   This is a -- they have unique circumstances than other schools,  okay?  St. Teresa,  Ponce, Coral Gables,  all those schools,  they have parking.   They don' t have parking.   They do not have parking.  So, we need to come up with a solution,  okay, where they actively patrol or do something, but they' re not doing that.   But then we also need to know,  what are their future plans?   Are we going to keep on --  they' re one single- family home away from owning all of Coral Way,  okay, Orlando' s home and the one that they bought here.   And that' s it, we' re done.   So,  what is the future plans here?  And what are we going to do about the parking?  Because yeah,  we do want it addressed. We don' t want our parking -our driveways blocked,  and we don' t want our grass dead.   We want to be good neighbors,  and we want them to have their building.  We don' t have an issue with their building.   Who doesn' t want that?   And I mean,  I don' t have an issue with the building.   We do have an issue, two things, future plans, expansion,  and our parking situation.   It's not actively being dealt with.  You could put that in those papers and those newsletters.   Hey, how many emails do we send out and we just go pass,  pass,  pass,  pass?   That' s a newsletter. Same thing here.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   But before you leave, Mr. Clerk, how many individuals\n\ndo we have?\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:   That' s it, okay,  so we' ll close the public comment.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'd like rebuttal.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know.\n\nMs. Russo:   Okay.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just want to put something on the record so my colleagues -is there one or two readings here?\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:   Two readings,  sir.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two readings,  okay.  So, we may move forward as a Commission today.  I think it's important to continue to strive for the best education for the community. I mean,  again,  we' re having major issues here in South Florida, especially here in Coral Gables.  In addressing the needs to educate our young children here, we have a disaster.   I mean,  I get calls constantly from people, hey,  help me try to get my kids into the school,  and I tell them the same thing.   I say,  I have no power to get anybody into any school.   Call your school board member or call the owner of the school and see if they can help you,  but again at the end of the day,  we fail on that front.   But I also have an issue with the encroachment in the residential neighborhoods. There has to be something done for the future.   We' ve got to start working together and planning.   I'm going to say something that you' re not going to like and maybe some of your residents may not like, but we need to figure out a way to either build some sort of parking structure,  one or two floors, something that works for the community that can be done in a way that, you know, wraps the first floor in maybe offices or educational because if they' re going to continue to expand,  you know, at the end of the day, you' re going to have to address the parking issue.   Because you' re not going to be able to meet the parking needs.   You' re not going to.  And there' s also --  I was looking at the minutes from the Planning and Zoning Board meeting. They were clear about,  obviously,  the swale package.   That already exists in the legislation,  it' s there.   I wrote that legislation.   It' s very simple.  It's something that, again, doesn' t cost anything.  The permit is free.  It gives you guidance in regards to a swale package to put on to basically avoid any parking on the swale.   Your biggest concern right now is the issue of parking and the condition of your swale,  correct?\n\nMs. Toyos:   Their growth.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Two.\n\nMayor Lago:   I understand\n\nthat.\n\nMs. Toyos:   We have two.\n\nMayor Lago:   But the growth thing is going to be a long-term issue that they' re going to have to work with their lawyers and the City to find a way to address it.   Because if you' re going to continue to grow,  and like you mentioned in other schools,  they don' t have the parking.   They don' t have the parking if they' re going to grow.  If they' re going to grow.  They haven' t told me they' re going to grow.   I don' t know anything about that.   But you' re making a statement that, obviously,  their plan is to continue to move --  to grow their footprint.\n\nMr. Toyos:   How many single-family homes are you going to keep on taking down?\n\nMayor Lago:   Again,  and I understand that,  but I just wanted to put it on the record that we' re going to have to find some sort of solution,  and the solution' s not going to make everybody happy.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Well, I think a parking lot there,  a structured -Mayor,  I think that you' re going to definitely get the neighbors\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   I'm just thinking --  and guess what, it's not going to happen.   Okay, but then let me tell you, then what do we do?  We' re going to park people,  let' s say,  at the Biltmore,  you know, and bring them in?\n\nMr. Toyos:  That' s --  you see,  you see, that --  this is where --  that' s not what we signed on for.\n\nMayor Lago:   I understand.\n\nMr. Toyos:  And let me tell you something.   They' re the ones who are expanding.   It' s not us.  We haven' t broken the covenant.   They have.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  Well, we don' t know if they broke the covenant or not, so let' s be very careful what we say here because,  at the end of the day, we' re under --  we' re all\u2026\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to --?\n\nMayor Lago:   We' re here\u2026\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to knock down this house according to the covenant?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   They are allowed to.   That' s my understanding. But again,  we deal with this, we deal with this with a lot of other schools that come before us.  For example,  Gulliver came before us in regards to an expansion of their footprint and they have to provide documents on a continual basis to show how many people are actually enrolled in the school.   A lot of schools have these covenants in place to show that they' re following the rules.   This is nothing new.   So, I have to look into that with the City Manager and my colleagues will do the same thing.   They' ll look at that with the City Manager and with Ms. Russo.   We' ll look at the documents to make sure that they' re adhering to the documents that must be submitted as per their agreement. If we' re not going to talk about expansion today,  that' s something that we' re going to talk about in the future, fine.   But I just want to put on the record,  there has to be --  a solution has to be found in the neighborhood,  because obviously,  this is not working.   And if the swale,  the Planning and Zoning Board is asking for cooperation from your client to put together some sort of swale package,  I want my -- I want input from my colleagues to see what do you think is the best opportunity,  and I know that Ms. Russo wants to respond,  so I'd like to hear from her first really quickly before we open up the (INAUDIBLE).   But we' ve got to find an answer here because it can' t be no swale package, then the only option that we have is we' ve got to get a public safety aide to basically be parked there,  you know, when school drop-off and pick up to make sure that nobody is encroaching or blocking the driveways.   Because,  by the way, we' ve dealt with this before.   We' ve dealt with it at Sunset.   We had multiple meetings on the ground.   I mean,  we had irate neighbors who were telling us, listen,  I couldn' t get out of my driveway for 45 minutes.   People were so desperate to avoid the line on Sunset that they would park their cars,  and then what ended up happening was, you know, I had to wait 45 minutes to go to work or to a doctor' s appointment because I couldn' t get out.  And this is nothing new.  It's just, again,  it' s one of the things that we' re dealing with as being one of the cities that everybody wants to live in and send their kids to school.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Mr. Mayor, I'm sensitive to the needs of the community in regards to how do you call it, their educational needs for the broader\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   But you also want quality of life and I respect that.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But specific to this location,  we' re probably at the point that we shouldn' t have been at because of prior decisions made here with single-family homes that shouldn' t have been schools with no parking.   Yeah,  I mean,  and for me to be given right now a solution that,  hey,  maybe we build a parking garage in this neighborhood,  that will go --  that' s going to go very\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   That wasn' t my intent.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   I know, I know.\n\nMayor Lago:   My intent was that we need to\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   You understand what I'm saying?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMayor Lago:   Find some sort of solutions\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Yeah.\n\nMayor Lago:   Outside of, you know, to alleviate parking.   And what are the two options?   Three options.   Either you bus people in from somewhere else, you build a surface parking lot.  For that, you got to buy more properties and knock them down,  or you have to build a parking structure. There' s no other way to do this.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Here' s the only solution I --  one of the\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   You already have parking issues.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We already have parking issues,  but we also have single-family home that has been purchased by the school,  which has single-family zoning.   And I'm bringing it to your attention today on this date.  So, go --  let it go on the record,  okay\u2026\n\nMs. Tuyos:   That' s what they' re doing.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   That we do not want this continued expansion of single- family zoning and singlefamily homes,  okay, being built into future classroom space.\n\nMayor Lago:   I want to address one point before we hear from Ms. Russo,  okay.   So,  we can approve today,  moving on to second reading,  but one of the things that I would want is for there to be a real discussion between you and the school' s representative,  Russo,  and that the Manager' s team be engaged on that front.  Because there has to be -- I will not approve this on second reading if we don' t have a solution to, at a minimum --  because we' re not going to find a parking solution today,  okay,  and we' re not going to find it in the next five years. You know,  we have,  at a minimum,  we have to find something so that your quality of life is not impacted,  okay?  I haven' t been on the ground to see the, you know,  drop-off and pickup.   I've done it in other schools.   I know my colleagues have also.   So,  this is something that maybe we should see firsthand what we' re having. And I've done it where we don' t even -we don' t announce that we' re going because I want to see it when it's\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Really happening not where\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Let' s do it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Not when parents have been notified.  But I think that what we need to do is -- what we need to do is we need to have a conversation between first and second reading,  maybe the City Attorney can also join the conversation to find a solution to address what the Planning and Zoning Board and what your requests are.  There has to be common ground.   Ms. Russo?\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we did that by the way.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know, I know, but let me hear from Ms. Russo.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' ve reached out several times.\n\nMayor Lago:   And I want my colleagues to give me input and give me advice on what they would like to see.\n\nMs. Russo:   So, I'd like to rebut a couple of the statements.   So, with use of the swale,  I'm going to submit some photos that were taken not only of the neighbor' s home,  but of the church house across the street.   And Reverend Conroy will come address the use of that property.   And there are people parked on the swale of the church property that are cars that visit the home across the street. So, the use of the swale is being used as, you know, a public right-of-way for parking.   So, I just want to submit these pictures because it' s not just happening on their side of the street. It' s happening on the church property and people that use his home.   And some of these are taken at six in the morning,  so they' re not taken,  you know, when drop-off.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   You can put\u2026\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:  Just make sure the Clerk has them,  please.\n\nMayor Lago:   Give them to the Clerk.\n\nMs. Russo:   And so I can let you know that I've been representing the school since 2000, I believe it was 2000 when I was first hired in 2001 through 3 when we did the master site plan.  And I can tell you that the that the master site plan did involve a new building.   The church,  as you know, owns a home in which Reverend Conroy lives.  They also own a home on Coral Way.  They have visiting clergy,  and all of this was addressed in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants.   We are here precisely because one of the conditions from the restrictive covenants was that if any building were to be demolished,  that it would have to go through the public hearing process and be approved\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nand go --  and you know,  be approved by the Board of Architects and be approved. Because a church owns a property doesn' t make it part of the school.  But for that, I'm going to ask Reverend Conroy to just slip in the rebuttal the response to that.\n\nMs. Conroy:   Still Mary Beth Conroy,  still confused about swales.   The St. Philip' s has bought a series of homes throughout the years,  long before my arrival in 2016.   The home at 1100 Coral Way became available and we purchased it for a residence for our head of school.   We rented it for two years before the head of school moved in.  We had a head of school who lived there for two years.   And then since that time, we have housed clergy there.  It is not used for classroom.   It is not used for children.   It is not authorized for use for children.   And we have no intention of growing the number of children at our school.   What we want is better space,  but that house has never,  ever been used as a meeting place for children or teaching or anything.   We have a visiting bishop who comes for a month or two at a time.  We have --  that' s really all we' ve used it for is a residence.   So, it sits there empty a good part of the time, and occasionally,  we have someone stay there.   That' s it.   It' s a residence.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Do you have anything else, Ms. Russo?\n\nMs. Russo:   Excuse me?\n\nMayor Lago:   Do you have anything else you' d like to say?\n\nMs.  Russo: Yes,  I would just like to say that,  once again,  I think this is a community, a neighborhood issue.   It' s not an issue that should lay solely on the shoulders of St. Philip' s.   I'm aware of the swale package.   In fact, one of the neighbors --  we did have a neighborhood meeting, which the Toyos did not attend,  but the neighbor,  Dr. Forachi ( phonetic)  and the Lopez Cotardi phonetic),  we talked about the ability to landscape your swale since there has been so much use of a public swale.   I happen to live on Country Club Prado,  so I'm well aware how people use swale all the time to enjoy the city park.   And if I were to be so inclined to keep people from parking there,  I could avail myself of this. Deena Bell Llewellyn has done a great job of recommending native plant material and other materials,  you know,  shrubs and up to a certain height, et cetera, and doing this without having to pay for a permit and facilitating the hand drawing of it, et cetera.   And I shared that information with the neighbor who attended the meeting.   So, once again,  I ask you for approval of the building.  We understand the neighborhood dilemma,  but I ask you that we join as neighbors to try to figure out the problem and not lay it solely at the feet of a nonprofit that is not increasing students,  okay?   Because if in fact there were an increase in students,  I would be saying,  yeah,  we' re going to have a bigger impact.   I think we should do something,  but we' re not.   And I know the school complies with the affidavit as do the other schools with respect to the student cap.   So, you know, we do not want to enlarge the school.   We want to keep it a very small neighborhood school.   And again,  it's been there for 70 some years.\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   Thank you very much.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes, Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: So, long before I ran for office, I dealt with parking issues in neighborhoods, in our neighborhood. I live within a block of Le Jeune Road. There was a construction project coming in of a multi-story building on Le Jeune Road and spoke to neighbors, and we came up with a resolution and the neighbors voted to have --  one neighbor wanted grass put in, but we went with residential parking permit signs.   I warned my neighbor who parked all the time on his swale that his grass would not live, and it didn' t.  Because once you start driving on it, it dies.   The heat of the engine,  the wear and tear in the car, you have to irrigate it,  all those things go into grass or any planting.  And then we have other areas in our city that have high traffic. We have Venetian Pool, the Biltmore Hotel,  around the United Congregational Church of Christ. They have high traffic as well.  My neighborhood still had high traffic.   In fact, I had MercedesBenz employees parking at my property instead of them paying for parking for those folks.  So, I had a few words with Mercedes- Benz.   I said, I'll be darned if I'm going to pay for parking of my employee so they can park at the building and you' re burdening my property with all your employees.   So, there are solutions.   And I'd like to hear --  you know, I'd like for our Landscape Division to go out there and discuss some of the solutions with you all because,  if you want landscaping,  you' re going to lose parking.   If you want landscaping to live, you have to water it. You have to realize now you' re not going to have the parking.   But there are other solutions if you do want parking for yourself,  for your guests,  such as we have the fancy coquina,  the nice gravel, all part of the swale package.   There are items in the swale package you can put in that require less water,  but I wouldn' t say that they need no water.   You have to get them established. And you can' t be parking on top of them,  you know.   One of the challenges that one of our residents has met is he put in landscaping and still, you know, people don' t care and they roll over it because it' s not their property.   So,  once upon a time,  we required FP&amp; L and Comcast to put plantings around their boxes.  Slowly but surely, that has come and rests upon the shoulders of the residents. I think if you want a planted swale,  you need to make some decisions on what you want,  because you' re going to have to maintain it.   Because if you don' t irrigate it,  you can' t expect it to live.  So, take a look at the residential parking permit program.   The residential parking permit signs are much,  much prettier.   Each one of us gets some emails from particular residents that don' t like parking signs.  They consider them ugly.  Why do we need all the signs?  We have sign pollution. But the ones that are residential parking permit are green poles,  extruded,  and a much nicer sign and blend in with the community and don' t upset some of those other residents we have in Coral Gables that don' t like ' No Parking' signs.   They call it sign pollution and they want to take the signs out.  In fact, in my neighborhood I'm getting a list of all the ' No Parking'  signs from all the neighbors that want them out so I can just have staff come out one time.  And --  but I would like staff to come out there and help advise between parking programs available. I can tell you the folks that face the Salvadore dog park, we had a long discussion about it.   I told them the options and they said if the parking became an issue on their side,  that they were going to go with the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential parking permit.   That was their choice.   And in closing,  I'll give you the history of the word swale.   I know it's funny.   It's a funny word.   I thought it was funny because no one else spoke it except for me at one point in time until I moved into Coral Gables.   And I learned that the etymology of it, at least locally here in the United States,  came from Pittsburgh.   And it's not a hidden fact that George Merrick came from the Pittsburgh area, the Philadelphia area.   And that is a word that was brought over from, you know, UK English descent type word.  So, you won' t find it heavily used outside of Coral Gables. It was transplanted here from the Northeast and they called it Pittsburgh- ese.   You can look at --  get a dictionary of Pittsburgh- ese and find it.  So\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Anybody else?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I do have a couple of comments. I'm in the area quite a bit during pickup and drop-off.  And I have to agree,  during drop-off, the park should not be an issue.   The park is not heavily used at drop-off time.  During pickup,  I do see your argument that the park is heavily used in the afternoon.   A lot of parents pick up their children from other schools and bring them to the park.   I think that' s something that as we continue to renovate our City parks and improve the City parks in other areas,  including Phillips Park,  hopefully beginning next year,  we will see some shift in that use,  but it is something that must be addressed. Because just seeing your pictures,  I've seen the cars parking in the swale every morning,  and I've seen the effect that it has on residences. Like Vice Mayor Anderson stated,  I myself have been a victim of people parking and blocking my driveway on a regular basis because of a business at the end of my block. So, I have seen that impact,  and in some cases,  we' ve tried to get the people to move and they just refused to do so.   We' ve had to call the police in order to get them out and remove them from blocking driveways.   What I would have liked to have seen prior to this is some sort of resolution between the school and the neighbors,  instead of having to get to this point where now we' re basically airing the neighborhood laundry here in the City Commission.   Between first and second reading,  like the Mayor said,  I think there needs to be a sit down and some sort of resolution between both sides on something that will work going forward.   If the plans are to expand,  I do have concerns because there is no parking there and that will be something that must be addressed. But I think the Mayor brought up a very good point of including the Manager in this conversation and the City Attorney,  because I think it' s also encumbered upon us in the City if we have made all these improvements on Salvadore Park,  that we are not creating more problems for the neighbors in the area and that we are part of finding a solution.   So, I think it' s something that we need to work together,  City,  the school,  and the neighbors on finding a solution that works for everybody.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner Menendez.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Thank you, Mayor.   Speaking of Salvadore Park,  I drove by the other evening,  and I noticed a great many cars parked,  I guess,  next to the dog park.   Is that --  have we\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nalways had folks parking --?   Because it' s not --  it' s dirt basically,  between the playground area and the dog park.  I just see there are parks there --  cars everywhere parked.   I don' t know if that' s officially a parking spot or\u2026\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' re looking --  I've already talked to -- after the dog park we opened the dog park, I noticed that that was a mud area,  and I've already talked to Public Works about changing that into some type of rock, like a granite, so that it can be used as a parking area,  yet not turn it into asphalt.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Okay,  because it is pretty clear that people are looking for parking spots where there aren' t any.   And I don' t recall in the past seeing cars there.   I too have --  I feel the same way.   The project in and of itself,  I think it' s a wonderful project,  well presented,  well thought out for all the right reasons,  but the fact that the different parties haven' t come to a meeting of the minds taints the whole process. We should be here celebrating a wonderful project that everybody can embrace,  but unfortunately,  there are a lot of loose ends.   So, that' s not a positive, not only with this item,  but with any item that comes before the City Commission. We' ve had plenty of items that just seem to sometimes unravel because one string is loose,  they pull and everything comes apart.   So, let' s try to avoid that.  I have a couple questions for, I guess,  the City Attorney.   Is -- so, the number of students that are allowed,  let' s start there.   That' s written where in terms of\u2026\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  In their prior approval,  and there' s a recorded covenant as well.  So --  and they' re not asking for an amendment to that or a change in connection\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And I understand.\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:  With this amendment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Exactly. And I'm not saying they are or that they will,  but to understand the legal ramifications of that agreement or that document,  what happens if a school does expand?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  They would have to come before you and request that. You would all review it and request approval of an amendment to their prior approvals.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And if we find out that they' ve added a hundred more students or 50 more students,  then what would the City have?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   So, they have to -- and maybe the planner can come up, but I think annually they submit an affidavit.   Isn' t that\u2026?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   City Planner,  Jennifer Garcia.   So,  they --  I believe they submit something every single year, every single school year to\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   I think it's done toward the middle of September.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:  ( INAUDIBLE)  every January.\n\nMs. Russo:   January.\n\nCity Planner\n\nGarcia:   January,  okay.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:   We send a letter ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Right.\n\nMs. Russo:   Right,  each school has it a little bit differently. I think some have it at the end of September,  but all the schools I've represented that have student limitations provide an annual affidavit on the student enrollment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   So, it's a viable legal binding agreement.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   Correct.   And if there was a violation,  then we would take action to enforce the covenant is what we would do.  That would be our recourse.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: And I agree,  there are other schools,  I know the charter school on Segovia,  when they were approved,  all the schools have their limitations.\n\nMs. Russo:   Gulliver,  St. Thomas also have student\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   But I know people are watching,  they want to know, well, is it binding? So, that' s good to know.  In terms of the footprint of the school,  Madam City Attorney,  when 2002 there were agreements,  things that were approved,  was the footprint of the school limited in any documentation?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  So, there is a site plan that was approved.   This is one of the buildings that is part of that site plan that it was --  the existing structure is smaller than what they are proposing. They' re proposing to demolish the existing building within the site plan and construct a larger building.   Is that accurate?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   How about the building itself?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   The building itself is the same size.   The extra square footage comes from the now enclosed concrete walkway for security purposes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I'm talking about the campus.\n\nMs. Russo:   Those of you with small children know that you can' t -- you don' t want access to children.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   So,  this -my understanding is that this request does not change the boundaries of the site plan.\n\nMs. Russo:   That is correct.   The boundaries remain the same.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   My follow-up question,  and I totally understand having a property that people can --  visitors can stay, you know, close to the school,  the church.  When they acquired that property --  and I totally support and understand having it for guests --  did that change the footprint of the campus,  or is that something they should have notified the City that we' ve added a property?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  No, they have a right to purchase and own property.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   It has --  it is not connected to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.   Right, and no, I just want to check off the boxes.\n\nMs. Russo:   Yeah,  to connect it, let' s just say,  we' re not going to do it, but let' s just say,  it would have to come before DRC, it would have to go before the Planning and Zoning Board, and it would be a change in land use and a change in zoning and a major amendment to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Like I said,  the fact that you' re not having classes or events,  it's --  I understand the need for it.  I just don' t want to cross that line at any point because it' s not good for the school,  the church,  or the City in general,  or obviously,  the residents.   I totally support the direction my colleagues are headed with between first and second reading.   I personally suggest don' t bring this back on second reading unless there' s a true agreement because we don' t want to repeat today.   And with regards to signage,  the residential permit,  I asked the City Manager,  that area does qualify for it, but again,  things have to be enforced and we all know because we have traffic circles,  we have speed bumps,  sometimes physical additions are required because people just regardless of what the sign says,  do whatever they want.   So, I'm in support of the direction my colleagues are headed with this first to second reading.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay,  so we can close this out between first and second,  if I'm getting the vibe of what this Commission is headed. So,  we' re going to move forward on first reading.   To move forward,  obviously,  we' re going to take a vote now.   What we' re requesting between first and second is -- okay, would you like to say something?\n\nMs. Russo:   No, no.\n\nMayor Lago:   No, I just want to make sure.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'm just acknowledging that we' re going to be meeting with the City Attorney and City Manager.\n\nMayor Lago:   What I would like is for there to be a meeting between the applicant and the City, the City Attorney,  City Manager,  and yourself,  if any other residents would like to join, to make sure that we address the issues with the swales.   What are we talking about?   A swale package of one form or another,  or what the Vice Mayor said in regards to the opportunity to address resident parking,  which has to be enforced.   Again,  that puts another burden of proof on you, because I'll tell you why.   Because you have to call --  if someone parks there,  you have to call and get it enforced.   When you have the swale package in place, you' re not calling anybody because no one, unless they' re, you know,  destructive individuals and they park over the swale package,  I don' t think many people are going to park over that.  At least in my yard, which I have the swale package, the ferns,  you can' t park on the swale.   There' s no opportunity.   But if you really wanted to, you could.  You would potentially get your car stuck in there.  So, my point is that we' re going to move forward between first and second reading,  but there will be a meeting where you will be there.  I'm also asking for the Manager and for his team to please pick a day that they do not notify the applicant during school hours to make sure that we visit and we understand exactly what' s happening,  either during drop-off and pickup,  to get a better understanding of where we are right now in regards to what they' re facing in that neighborhood.   Are there anything else that we need to add as requests between first and second?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   With those conditions,  I would move it.  You know, they need to have a meeting also with our staff to understand what the choices are on these residential parking permit signs because then you have a decal or a paper that goes in on the car and someone will be ticketed if you call if they park there without having that permit sign.  So, make sure you study your choices so you can make the best informed choice.   You know, everybody likes something different.   We don' t all like the same flavor of ice cream.   So, really,  the choice is in your --  on you.\n\nMayor Lago:   The goal...\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we didn' t want to be here.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But the reality is that we' ve reached out ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   I think I'm going to think the words out of your mouth.   The intent of today is to turn a new leaf and hopefully start building a relationship between the school and yourself that is something where you can become partners.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' re open to it.\n\nMayor Lago: Become partners because you' re not going anywhere, the school' s not going anywhere,  the park' s not going anywhere.   So, what we need to do is work together so that we just continue to advance quality of life in the neighborhood.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Agreed.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think Ms. Russo had a comment from a resident that you want to maybe deliver.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, that was Ed Diaz and I told him, he came up with an idea and I said let' s save that for when we all meet.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just wanted to make sure\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   Together.\n\nMayor Lago:   We put your idea on the record and please.\n\nMs. Russo:   He' s the chief operating officer, so he deals a lot with the parents and asking them not to park on swales ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   We welcome all ideas between first and second.   So, I need a motion,  if I may.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I'll move it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Second.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes. Commissioner Castro:   Yes. Commissioner Fernandez:   Yes. Commissioner Menendez:   Yes. Mayor Lago:   Yes. Vote:  5-0)\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Do you know when this will be coming back,  Mr. Manager?   Do you know when this is coming back?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   So, it'd be, I think, up to the applicant when they' re ready to come back, as long as we have time to provide mail notice.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think we need to work on a few things before bringing it back.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  I think one meeting is going to be a little bit too quick.\n\nMs. Russo:   Right, I think --  I was going to say,  I think we should make it for the second meeting in February\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Perfectly\n\nfine.\n\nMs. Russo:   To give us enough time\u2026\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think so.\n\nMs. Russo:   With all our different schedules.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think that would be --  I think second meeting in February is right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Because I think that we can\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   Right, second meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think we can potentially resolve this, find middle ground with those signs that the Vice Mayor mentioned could be really --  could really be an opportunity to really resolve it.   And any --  and again,  now' s the time to address other issues that are both beneficial for the school and for yourself.   And maybe the City can do better in that area.   Maybe we can be a better partner in one form or another.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   If we go the route of the signs,  I'll tell you right now, the signs --  and the reason I smile is because the signs are being used with tape lines to hold barricades that are not supposed to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:   And that' s what we' re going to -- and that' s what we' re going to talk about.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   And they' re not being enforced.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: That' s why I said to meet with the Landscape Department. They' re fabulous.   We have a nice swale package.\n\nMs. Russo:   And maybe someone from Parks and Rec could also be at the meeting\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Good idea.\n\nMs. Russo:   Since\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nMs. Russo:   Along with the City Manager and the City Attorney.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Manager will make sure that his team is there.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Well, I think we cannot leave Salvadore issue --  park issue out, so I expect them to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.  So, we' ll --  then we' ll be hearing you from the end of February,  correct?\n\nMs. Russo:   The end of February,  yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   That gives enough time to have meetings and everything like that.\n\nMs. Russo:   Perfect.\n\nMayor Lago: Alright,  we' re going to take a five-minute break so everybody can go to the bathroom.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   And then we' ll be back for E-8.  Thank you.\n\nMs. Russo:   Thank you, thank you.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024",

Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you' ll provide today will be the truth and nothing but the truth?\n\n## COMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   Ms. Russo,  good morning.\n\nLaura Russo:  Good morning,  Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of the Commission.   My name is Laura Russo with offices at 2334 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, and I am here this morning representing St.  Philip' s Episcopal Church and School. I have with me Reverend Mary Beth Conroy,  Ed Diaz,  who is Chief Operations Officer,  Norma Diaz,  who is Head of School,  also supporting us is Sissy Slesnick,  who is a parishioner,  Octavio Santurio,  who is the architect of the project.   I'll give you a little bit of background.   St. Philip' s has been in the City of Coral Gables as a church for 80 years.   The school has been in existence for 70 years.   For those of you who don' t know the exact location,  it is located on the block that is bounded by Coral Way to the north, Andalusia to the south,  Columbus to the west,  and Cordova to the east. Back in 2001 through 2003,  St. Philip' s underwent a master plan process.   And in that process,  it was proposing a new building,  but during that process,  it underwent a total review of its operations.   Conditions were imposed,  limiting the number of students,  setting up the drop-off operation,  legislating certain landscaping,  making sure that any changes to a site plan would go before a public hearing process, making decisions with respect to colors of the building so that the school would blend into the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential neighborhood,  parking for employees in the lot to the east of Salvadore Park,  and also dealing with special event permits for the special events that were held either by the school or by the church.   Again, to put it into a geographic location,  the school is located immediately north of Salvadore Park that as you know has a whole playground section,  tennis courts, a pickleball court, the little parking lot to the east and a dog park now. The request that we are making today is to demolish an existing building that sits at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia and replace it with another building.   The idea is -- well, the reason for it is the building was old, had sagging floors and had a lot of issues and it made more sense to demolish the building and build a new one.   The new structure will be approximately the same size.   It will house the same two classrooms,  Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, a multi-purpose room and storage area.  The difference in the square footage is that there is now a covered walkway that is a canopy and it's an awning and that,  for security purposes,  will be enclosed and it will connect to another building on the campus.   Let' s see,  the Board of Architects has approved the new building. We went twice to the Board of Architects.   They wanted windows on the eastern side of the new building.   One of the conditions that was imposed in the 2001-2003 master plan would be that no building would have any windows on the eastern side.  Board of Architects insisted that it would look too institutional,  which is what we were trying to avoid,  and so they asked that we change that condition and the windows are fixed and operable windows.   They' re meant for an aesthetic purpose,  not to function.   They are actually on the portion of the building that' s closest to the front, which is adjacent to the driveway and garage of the adjacent neighbor to the east of us.   The balance of the building,  which is in back,  which would face the single- family neighbor to the right is solid and there' s extensive landscaping that' s several feet wide that was put in back in 2003 as part of the condition for the original site plan. We appeared before the Planning and Zoning Board. Staff recommended approval with three conditions,  that the windows remain fixed and inoperative,  that we keep every other condition,  including the limitation on the number of children,  and that we heavily landscape the front part of this building.  During COVID, the front part of this building was graveled in order to facilitate the drop-off when we first started going back to school.  And so it has remained gravel. That gravel will be removed after construction and that area in front of this will be heavily landscaped.   So, right now the drop-off is set up.  There is a drop-off for the older grades.   Third, fourth,  and fifth grade are dropped off in front of the school.   Four parking spaces are coned off and the parents come in going east to west so that the children can be dropped off on the sidewalk side and not on the street side.   And a neighbor that -who is here as well has appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and an additional condition was added to the approval. And the condition was that the church landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia. And so we' re here to respectfully request that we keep the conditions that were imposed by staff and eliminate that condition and I'd like to explain why.   First of all, those are not adjacent neighbors.   Those four properties,  one of them happens to belong to the church,  the one on the corner of --  the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova belongs to St. Philip' s. The other three are not adjacent, meaning they don' t abut the school property. We are not proposing an increase in students,  so we are not making a bigger impact.   The same number of students,  180, have gone to this school since 2001.  We are in an area where the increased activity and need for parking has come from the beautiful playground equipment that now adorns\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nSalvadore Park.   Having used it as a mother,  it's a vast improvement from what it was 30-some years ago.   There is also,  as you know, very active use of the tennis courts,  starting from early in the morning now that one of the courts has been designated a pickleball court,  one of the most popular sports in in the country.   And you also now have a dog park.  So, it is a neighborhood that has a lot of activity.   The school is there 172 days out of 365.   Yes,  the church does have its activities,  but I would submit to you that the school is not the only reason why there' s an issue with parking.   And I think it' s not fair to penalize the nonprofit school and institution that lives there,  but rather we should try to work as a community,  both the City and the church and school, to see if we can find a way to alleviate the parking on swales.   I brought --  because I want you to know the school tries very hard to make sure that parents don' t park in the swale.   That doesn' t mean they don' t, but they try very hard.   And I just brought two samples of newsletters.   So, this newsletter is published monthly,  and it goes out to all the school parents,  and I highlighted -there' s a whole section on parking.   I'm going to pass these around.   So,  it's not something that they say once at the beginning of the school year during orientation and just say,  okay,  we hope you guys pay attention to it.  No, they' re reminded on a regular basis,  and I can tell you that the Ed Diaz,  who' s chief of operations,  has been called by nearby residents to ask parents to,  you know,  leave the driveway or whatever. So,  we' re well aware of it and we try working hard to prevent it from happening.   But I think the burden of landscaping and maintaining non-adjacent neighbors is just -seems more like a penalty to a school. If I were asking for an increase in students,  I would say,  yeah,  of course,  because we' re going to now have a bigger impact on the community.   We' re bringing more cars to the area with more students.   But we still have the same students,  the same number of students for the last 22 years.   So, let me pass this around.\n\nCommissioner Castro: Since this is a quasi- judicial item,  I would like to disclose that I have received emails regarding this item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I've received emails as well.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Same here, so have I.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think everybody has,  so moving on.\n\nMs. Russo:  Alright,  so I respectfully request that you approve the proposal for the new building along with the staff-imposed conditions and eliminate the condition of landscaping the properties between Coral Way and Andalusia on Cordova.  And we' re here to answer any questions you may have, and I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal,  if necessary.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Director,  how are you?\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Good,  thank you.   Good morning,  Jennifer Garcia,  Planning Official.  If I could have the PowerPoint,  please.  Okay,  so we' re here for a major amendment to the approved 2002 site plan for St. Philip' s School.   As indicated,  this site is south of Coral Way to the east of\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nColumbus,  north of Andalusia,  and to just west of Cordova.  This is an aerial of the campus.  We' re talking about just the southeast portion of the campus,  which is now an existing house typology which was converted into a preschool.   So, the future land use designation is religious institutional use.   The zoning is special use.   So,  the Ordinance Number 3576 is what approved the site plan. And then there' s conditions regarding any changes to the site plan would have to require Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission review and approval,  as well as the no openings on the east fa\u00e7ade. So,  again,  we' re talking about the southeast portion of the site and looking at the proposed building,  it would have classrooms one and two for preschool on the front, the back-ofhouse equipment is located west of the building away from the single- family adjacent house, restored swale on the front of the structure of the proposed preschool building,  a front yard.   The storage is going to be acting as a buffer between the existing home to the east and the actual preschool area,  and in the back is a multi-purpose room and playground.   Here' s a rendering of what that looks like.  Again,  this was approved by the Board of Architects.   It went to DRC back in April of last year.   Board of Architects,  a couple of times, and approval in August.   They had a neighborhood meeting in October. Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval in November,  and here we are for first reading at City Commission.   So, the letters were sent to the property within a thousand feet as required by code,  and that happened three times so far.  It was posted twice,  three times website posting and once for newspaper advertisements. So,  staff has determined that it' s consistent with the comp plan and it complies with all the findings of fact, which is part of your packet and the staff report today.   So,  there' s two conditions of approval. The first one is the non-operable fixed windows on the fa\u00e7ade facing the adjacent abutting neighbor to the east.   The swale improvements on the front, and as she indicated,  the Planning and Zoning Board wanted to expand that and have it on Cordova as well between Coral Way and Andalusia to prevent parking and other issues that the school,  I guess,  has been dealing with for quite some time.  And all the conditions that are listed in Ordinance Number 3576 would still remain in effect. That' s it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Thank you.\n\nMs. Russo:  And if you want to see, I have a little PowerPoint that just shows you a little bit, if we can get it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Perfect,  thank you.\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Could we get the applicant PowerPoint,  please?  Press the big button.\n\nMs. Russo:  Next slide.   Alright,  this is the existing building,  so this is the building that' s being replaced,  the one again on the southeast corner of the campus.   This is the new proposed building. This is the area behind the school,  behind that particular building.   And this is existing.   And you can see there is a -- this particular house had an old detached garage that actually sat on the property\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nline.  So, one of the requirements of the original site plan is if this building ever came down, that garage that' s on the property line would have to be removed and needless to say, all setbacks would have to be observed.   This is what the back will look at.  It will now be set back from the neighbor to the east. And again,  the building that you see without the arches is the one that faces the neighbor and that has the blank wall.   The building with the arches is the one that will have the fixed inoperable windows near the front. This is what the space will look like. This is the multipurpose space.   I'm sorry, the other were the classrooms.   This is the multipurpose space that will also be able to work so that activities,  depending on weather,  as you can see,  it opens up to the backyard.   And that' s it.   I just wanted you to get a little glimpse of what we' re doing.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Mr. Mayor, we have several members of the public requesting to speak on this item.  The first is Norma Perez.\n\nMs. Russo:   She' s decided not to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Okay.\n\nMs. Russo:   They just signed in in case they wanted to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Edward Diaz.  Mary Conroy.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nMary Conroy:   Hi, I'm Mary Beth Conroy.   I'm the rector of St. Philip' s.   I've been here for 14 years.   And when I moved here,  I thought I had a great vocabulary,  but I did not know the word swale.   And so,  I've learned something about it.  And thanks to my friendly parishioners,  they taught me that I was to maintain my swale and that it did not belong to me.   And so,  for all the many years I've lived here,  I have replanted my swale,  like I'm sure many of you have.   I've endured neighbors doing construction projects joyfully,  and I'm happy to be in a community that works together so that we can live together in harmony. I will say that St.  Philip' s is in a neighborhood that' s in high demand for parking and we struggle with the same issues that our neighbors do and those who want to attend and use the glorious park that has been provided by the City.   It has only increased and become more challenging. And as Ms. Russo pointed out,  we continue to ask people to rideshare when we have big events,  whether it's a large funeral,  whether it' s a big event for the school.   We ask people to observe ' No Parking'  signs, to be mindful of the neighbors' driveways for their own safety.   And we try in every way we can to be a good and gracious neighbor.   And we' re happy to work with the City and with all of our neighbors and all the constituents to try to find reasonable solutions.   But I strongly believe that asking St. Philip' s\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nto take on in perpetuity to plant and maintain a non-adjacent neighbor swale is not only unfair, it's unneighborly. And so,  we' re here to really ask your permission to build a new building for our youngest learners.   And I hope you will support us.   Thank you.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Octavio\n\nSanturio.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, he' s --  no.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Cecilia Slesnick.\n\nCecelia Slesnick:   Good morning,  Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, Commissioners,  everyone on the dais. Cecilia Slesnick,  721 Navarre,  Coral Gables,  and many Coral Gables addresses before that.   As nearly a 23-year-long parishioner of St. Philip' s and a lifelong resident of the City of Coral Gables, I know the issue of parking.   I know the issue of swale,  a word which,  by the way, is constantly autocorrected if you' ve ever tried to spell it.   And I know how special our church community is at St.  Philip' s.   So,  as a parishioner,  I understand the challenges. As Ms. Russo pointed out,  the enrollment at the school is not going to be increasing.   And as you saw by the picture,  actually I think aesthetically it' s going to be a nice improvement to the block and will make it all feel much more cohesive,  which I appreciate as a realtor.   The second thing, as was noted,  is that the swales are public property.   And I remind that to my neighbors in my neighborhood.   And as I'm selling homes in Coral Gables,  I remind the homeowners that the swales are to be kept by you, but they are public property.   So, that' s where your visitors should park when they come to see you.  If you have deliveries,  if you have people coming to work at your home, that' s where they should park. They should not be blocking the sidewalks,  and they certainly shouldn' t be blocking --  parking in the streets like you do in other municipalities.   So, as a nonprofit,  as a church community,  which I know many of you on the dais can appreciate as churchgoers,  and all of you go to churches in this vicinity,  you can understand that it feels a little unfair.   Public parking is a bigger issue,  right? Especially on the footprint that we' re looking at.  The most welcome improvements to Salvadore Park.   Speaking as someone who swung on those rusty swings in the 1980s, and if you did, you' ll remember that they swayed a lot and it was really fun to see how high up you could go and not land in a tennis court.  So, the improvements are welcome.   My children love them.  Every Sunday when I park to go to church,  I hear the ping and the pong of the pickleballs and the tennis courts, and my golden retriever has loved the dog park.  So, all of these improvements bring not only joy and excitement to the City, but obviously,  it creates a little bit of congestion that everyone in the neighborhood has to work with, right?  The neighbors on Venetia,  the neighbors on Columbus,  all of the neighbors have to.  So, although I'm not speaking on behalf of the School and Community Relations Committee,  you all know that I am a member of the School and Community Relations Committee,  right?  SCRC,  School and Community Relations Committee.   And I'm not speaking on their behalf,  but because I'm a member and have been,  I know that every school in our community has its challenges with our ever-growing,  ever-evolving,  and ever-brightening city. So, let' s just keep that in mind as we go through this first reading and we move on to the second reading that every decision that' s made in and around schools potentially sets a precedent for all\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nof the other schools,  right?  For your children at St. Teresa,  for the children at ECC, to all the way to the children at Ponce and Gables and Gables Prep and et cetera,  et cetera,  et cetera.   So, thank you all so much.  And I hope to see you all at the Beaux Arts Festival this weekend.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Sorry, I won' t be able to make it.   I'll be in Montana.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   J. C. Toyos.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Toyos.  Good morning.\n\nJ. C. Toyos:  Good morning,  J. C. Toyos,  1044 Coral Way.\n\nWaldo Toyos:   Waldo Toyos, 1044 Coral Way.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And we' re here to speak against what they' re talking about.   I mean,  I'm shocked at the fact that you decided not to do what the Planning and Zoning Committee recommended in order to help the problems that we' re having with parking.   But aside from that,  we had sent an email to you guys because we have, looking into this issue,  found some other issues that we' d like to address that are important not just to me and my family, but to our community as a whole.  First, we would have really appreciated for them to reach out to us to let us know that they were no longer planning on doing what they said they were going to do.   So, it was kind of shocking for me to hear now that what they --  we thought were going to do as far as the parking situation to help alleviate it,  they' re not even going to do that.  And I've also been a part of the community for over 30 some odd years,  and he was born here.   So,  he also went to Salvadore Park,  and he was also coming to the area,  and we also have five children that are -  that were raised there.   So,  we know the community really well.   So,  this is also our family that is being impacted,  not just by what they' re planning on doing, but their future families,  if God bless,  they decide to stay in Coral Gables.   So, the first thing is the landscape.   I can' t believe you guys backed out of that.   I think it' s unconscionable to do so.  I do think that the reason that we' re having parking issues is because of the parents in the school.   And the reason for that is because it' s during the time periods that you guys are picking up your children and the children are being dropped off.  So, I do think it's a responsibility that the school bears,  and I do think that you guys should take care of it.  Second, what we found during some research is that the school' s growing.   They' re saying that they' re capped,  and they' re saying that they' re keeping their covenant. I couldn' t find the covenant to review it.   So, I haven' t\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   I have a copy.  The covenant is recorded in the public records of Miami- Dade County.\n\nMs. Toyos:  They' re growing.   And not only are they growing by square footage,  they' re growing in acquiring homes right across from my house.   They bought the house right across from us, and they' re using it for their school activities.   So,  I think that the covenant has been broken,  simply because if they were originally just going to be a school with their original homes and the original\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nsquare footage that they have,  their square footage is already grown with the new addition and changes they' ve made.   And if you look at the plot lines of the lots, they' ve encroached on them. In other words,  one lot encroaches on another lot, and then they expand on that classroom.   And then when they bought the house across the street from us, I don' t know what you guys are using it for, I'd like to know because they do have a lot of activity going on in there,  and a lot of kids and parents coming in and out.  So, there are questions that were brought to my mind that weren' t there before because of this issue.   And if they are going to make an amendment to the covenant, I would like some things changed to that covenant going forward in order for this to be approved. Okay, baby, your turn.\n\nMr. Toyos:   I think that,  how do you call it, first of all, this thing about the --  what the Planning and Zoning Board,  it wasn' t us who asked for the swale improvement. It was the Planning and Zoning Board that said,  hey, you, you guys, this is on you.   It wasn' t us asking the Planning and Zoning Board.   We just went up there and,  how do you call it, said we have a traffic problem. They' re blocking our driveways.   Yeah,  I mean,  and this happens,  how do you call it, constantly. And I keep on hearing it's the Salvadore Park, people who come to Salvadore Park,  the dog park, the pickleballers.   I don' t see people with pickleball rackets coming down, you know, blocking our driveways or doing that.  We' re trying to just keep our swales like any normal one.  Yes, we have normal use of swale,  delivery guys,  postal service,  whatever. But at least with that,  we could maintain our grass.   We can' t maintain our grass.   Their side looks like a desert,  okay, on Cordova side.\n\nMs. Toyos:  ( INAUDIBLE)  the pictures?\n\nMr.  Toyos: One of our neighbors behind them has had his swale with,  how do you call it, landscaping now for, as long as I can remember.   You know, we' ve owned that property for over 20 years. They' ve had it for much more than that,  so they' ve dealt with it.   Our backdoor neighbors,  Mary and --  this is what it looks like.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is what the neighbors do to our sidewalks.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And this is what the other neighbors have to do to make sure that they don' t block them when the pickup and drop-off (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is barricades put up by, I guess,  the City.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:   The signs are being used to help the --  the signs alone are not enough.   This is what they' ve used to keep the people off the corner so that the intersection visibility doesn' t get blocked.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Toyos:   Sometimes I can' t get out of my house because people are blocking my entrance and exit.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Backdoor neighbor,  she had to put it because her driveway' s in the front, so Andalusia, corner of Andalusia,  and right behind us,  and -on Cordova,  they had to put landscape in their front.  Now their side is still barren.   They can' t do anything.   It's --  I mean,  we can' t maintain our grass.   And it's not the people using the dog park.   It's not the people using the pickleball courts or tennis courts.  It's parents.   And we reached out to the pastor,  with all due respect,  in 2022.  We went in and we sat with her.  Nothing' s come from it.  Nothing.   The Planning and Zoning asked them,  hey, reach out to the neighbor.   Just try to take care of their situation.\n\nMs. Toyos:   They didn' t reach out.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Nothing.   We' ve tried to be neighborly. And to say that we' re not --  asking is not neighborly,  no, it was the Planning and Zoning Board.   All of them agreed that, hey, this is on you guys.   This is not on them.   So, we just want a solution,  but we also want to know --  there' s two issues here.   They bought that house in 2016 and now has an exemption.   So, they' re paying $ 67. So, I imagine that they' re having a school and it says an educational exemption on that property in the corner right across from us.  And by the way, we' re only 130 feet.  We might not be adjacent, but our radius,  we' re 130 feet from their closest property line, their campus property line.  So,  if they' re there and they' re claiming that exemption,  what' s the use of this property?   Because this is what' s causing the issues. If they' re going to keep on buying single- family homes and converting them over into school space,  it defeats the purpose.   They have no parking.   They have zero parking.   This should have been done with 30, 40 years ago when they expanded or they did this amendment and all that stuff.  This should have taken place because they just didn' t have the parking.   This is a -- they have unique circumstances than other schools,  okay?  St. Teresa,  Ponce, Coral Gables,  all those schools,  they have parking.   They don' t have parking.   They do not have parking.  So, we need to come up with a solution,  okay, where they actively patrol or do something, but they' re not doing that.   But then we also need to know,  what are their future plans?   Are we going to keep on --  they' re one single- family home away from owning all of Coral Way,  okay, Orlando' s home and the one that they bought here.   And that' s it, we' re done.   So,  what is the future plans here?  And what are we going to do about the parking?  Because yeah,  we do want it addressed. We don' t want our parking -our driveways blocked,  and we don' t want our grass dead.   We want to be good neighbors,  and we want them to have their building.  We don' t have an issue with their building.   Who doesn' t want that?   And I mean,  I don' t have an issue with the building.   We do have an issue, two things, future plans, expansion,  and our parking situation.   It's not actively being dealt with.  You could put that in those papers and those newsletters.   Hey, how many emails do we send out and we just go pass,  pass,  pass,  pass?   That' s a newsletter. Same thing here.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   But before you leave, Mr. Clerk, how many individuals\n\ndo we have?\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:   That' s it, okay,  so we' ll close the public comment.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'd like rebuttal.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know.\n\nMs. Russo:   Okay.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just want to put something on the record so my colleagues -is there one or two readings here?\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:   Two readings,  sir.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two readings,  okay.  So, we may move forward as a Commission today.  I think it's important to continue to strive for the best education for the community. I mean,  again,  we' re having major issues here in South Florida, especially here in Coral Gables.  In addressing the needs to educate our young children here, we have a disaster.   I mean,  I get calls constantly from people, hey,  help me try to get my kids into the school,  and I tell them the same thing.   I say,  I have no power to get anybody into any school.   Call your school board member or call the owner of the school and see if they can help you,  but again at the end of the day,  we fail on that front.   But I also have an issue with the encroachment in the residential neighborhoods. There has to be something done for the future.   We' ve got to start working together and planning.   I'm going to say something that you' re not going to like and maybe some of your residents may not like, but we need to figure out a way to either build some sort of parking structure,  one or two floors, something that works for the community that can be done in a way that, you know, wraps the first floor in maybe offices or educational because if they' re going to continue to expand,  you know, at the end of the day, you' re going to have to address the parking issue.   Because you' re not going to be able to meet the parking needs.   You' re not going to.  And there' s also --  I was looking at the minutes from the Planning and Zoning Board meeting. They were clear about,  obviously,  the swale package.   That already exists in the legislation,  it' s there.   I wrote that legislation.   It' s very simple.  It's something that, again, doesn' t cost anything.  The permit is free.  It gives you guidance in regards to a swale package to put on to basically avoid any parking on the swale.   Your biggest concern right now is the issue of parking and the condition of your swale,  correct?\n\nMs. Toyos:   Their growth.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Two.\n\nMayor Lago:   I understand\n\nthat.\n\nMs. Toyos:   We have two.\n\nMayor Lago:   But the growth thing is going to be a long-term issue that they' re going to have to work with their lawyers and the City to find a way to address it.   Because if you' re going to continue to grow,  and like you mentioned in other schools,  they don' t have the parking.   They don' t have the parking if they' re going to grow.  If they' re going to grow.  They haven' t told me they' re going to grow.   I don' t know anything about that.   But you' re making a statement that, obviously,  their plan is to continue to move --  to grow their footprint.\n\nMr. Toyos:   How many single-family homes are you going to keep on taking down?\n\nMayor Lago:   Again,  and I understand that,  but I just wanted to put it on the record that we' re going to have to find some sort of solution,  and the solution' s not going to make everybody happy.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Well, I think a parking lot there,  a structured -Mayor,  I think that you' re going to definitely get the neighbors\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   I'm just thinking --  and guess what, it's not going to happen.   Okay, but then let me tell you, then what do we do?  We' re going to park people,  let' s say,  at the Biltmore,  you know, and bring them in?\n\nMr. Toyos:  That' s --  you see,  you see, that --  this is where --  that' s not what we signed on for.\n\nMayor Lago:   I understand.\n\nMr. Toyos:  And let me tell you something.   They' re the ones who are expanding.   It' s not us.  We haven' t broken the covenant.   They have.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  Well, we don' t know if they broke the covenant or not, so let' s be very careful what we say here because,  at the end of the day, we' re under --  we' re all\u2026\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to --?\n\nMayor Lago:   We' re here\u2026\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to knock down this house according to the covenant?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   They are allowed to.   That' s my understanding. But again,  we deal with this, we deal with this with a lot of other schools that come before us.  For example,  Gulliver came before us in regards to an expansion of their footprint and they have to provide documents on a continual basis to show how many people are actually enrolled in the school.   A lot of schools have these covenants in place to show that they' re following the rules.   This is nothing new.   So, I have to look into that with the City Manager and my colleagues will do the same thing.   They' ll look at that with the City Manager and with Ms. Russo.   We' ll look at the documents to make sure that they' re adhering to the documents that must be submitted as per their agreement. If we' re not going to talk about expansion today,  that' s something that we' re going to talk about in the future, fine.   But I just want to put on the record,  there has to be --  a solution has to be found in the neighborhood,  because obviously,  this is not working.   And if the swale,  the Planning and Zoning Board is asking for cooperation from your client to put together some sort of swale package,  I want my -- I want input from my colleagues to see what do you think is the best opportunity,  and I know that Ms. Russo wants to respond,  so I'd like to hear from her first really quickly before we open up the (INAUDIBLE).   But we' ve got to find an answer here because it can' t be no swale package, then the only option that we have is we' ve got to get a public safety aide to basically be parked there,  you know, when school drop-off and pick up to make sure that nobody is encroaching or blocking the driveways.   Because,  by the way, we' ve dealt with this before.   We' ve dealt with it at Sunset.   We had multiple meetings on the ground.   I mean,  we had irate neighbors who were telling us, listen,  I couldn' t get out of my driveway for 45 minutes.   People were so desperate to avoid the line on Sunset that they would park their cars,  and then what ended up happening was, you know, I had to wait 45 minutes to go to work or to a doctor' s appointment because I couldn' t get out.  And this is nothing new.  It's just, again,  it' s one of the things that we' re dealing with as being one of the cities that everybody wants to live in and send their kids to school.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Mr. Mayor, I'm sensitive to the needs of the community in regards to how do you call it, their educational needs for the broader\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   But you also want quality of life and I respect that.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But specific to this location,  we' re probably at the point that we shouldn' t have been at because of prior decisions made here with single-family homes that shouldn' t have been schools with no parking.   Yeah,  I mean,  and for me to be given right now a solution that,  hey,  maybe we build a parking garage in this neighborhood,  that will go --  that' s going to go very\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   That wasn' t my intent.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   I know, I know.\n\nMayor Lago:   My intent was that we need to\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   You understand what I'm saying?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMayor Lago:   Find some sort of solutions\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Yeah.\n\nMayor Lago:   Outside of, you know, to alleviate parking.   And what are the two options?   Three options.   Either you bus people in from somewhere else, you build a surface parking lot.  For that, you got to buy more properties and knock them down,  or you have to build a parking structure. There' s no other way to do this.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Here' s the only solution I --  one of the\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   You already have parking issues.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We already have parking issues,  but we also have single-family home that has been purchased by the school,  which has single-family zoning.   And I'm bringing it to your attention today on this date.  So, go --  let it go on the record,  okay\u2026\n\nMs. Tuyos:   That' s what they' re doing.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   That we do not want this continued expansion of single- family zoning and singlefamily homes,  okay, being built into future classroom space.\n\nMayor Lago:   I want to address one point before we hear from Ms. Russo,  okay.   So,  we can approve today,  moving on to second reading,  but one of the things that I would want is for there to be a real discussion between you and the school' s representative,  Russo,  and that the Manager' s team be engaged on that front.  Because there has to be -- I will not approve this on second reading if we don' t have a solution to, at a minimum --  because we' re not going to find a parking solution today,  okay,  and we' re not going to find it in the next five years. You know,  we have,  at a minimum,  we have to find something so that your quality of life is not impacted,  okay?  I haven' t been on the ground to see the, you know,  drop-off and pickup.   I've done it in other schools.   I know my colleagues have also.   So,  this is something that maybe we should see firsthand what we' re having. And I've done it where we don' t even -we don' t announce that we' re going because I want to see it when it's\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Really happening not where\u2026\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Let' s do it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Not when parents have been notified.  But I think that what we need to do is -- what we need to do is we need to have a conversation between first and second reading,  maybe the City Attorney can also join the conversation to find a solution to address what the Planning and Zoning Board and what your requests are.  There has to be common ground.   Ms. Russo?\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we did that by the way.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know, I know, but let me hear from Ms. Russo.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' ve reached out several times.\n\nMayor Lago:   And I want my colleagues to give me input and give me advice on what they would like to see.\n\nMs. Russo:   So, I'd like to rebut a couple of the statements.   So, with use of the swale,  I'm going to submit some photos that were taken not only of the neighbor' s home,  but of the church house across the street.   And Reverend Conroy will come address the use of that property.   And there are people parked on the swale of the church property that are cars that visit the home across the street. So, the use of the swale is being used as, you know, a public right-of-way for parking.   So, I just want to submit these pictures because it' s not just happening on their side of the street. It' s happening on the church property and people that use his home.   And some of these are taken at six in the morning,  so they' re not taken,  you know, when drop-off.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   You can put\u2026\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:  Just make sure the Clerk has them,  please.\n\nMayor Lago:   Give them to the Clerk.\n\nMs. Russo:   And so I can let you know that I've been representing the school since 2000, I believe it was 2000 when I was first hired in 2001 through 3 when we did the master site plan.  And I can tell you that the that the master site plan did involve a new building.   The church,  as you know, owns a home in which Reverend Conroy lives.  They also own a home on Coral Way.  They have visiting clergy,  and all of this was addressed in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants.   We are here precisely because one of the conditions from the restrictive covenants was that if any building were to be demolished,  that it would have to go through the public hearing process and be approved\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nand go --  and you know,  be approved by the Board of Architects and be approved. Because a church owns a property doesn' t make it part of the school.  But for that, I'm going to ask Reverend Conroy to just slip in the rebuttal the response to that.\n\nMs. Conroy:   Still Mary Beth Conroy,  still confused about swales.   The St. Philip' s has bought a series of homes throughout the years,  long before my arrival in 2016.   The home at 1100 Coral Way became available and we purchased it for a residence for our head of school.   We rented it for two years before the head of school moved in.  We had a head of school who lived there for two years.   And then since that time, we have housed clergy there.  It is not used for classroom.   It is not used for children.   It is not authorized for use for children.   And we have no intention of growing the number of children at our school.   What we want is better space,  but that house has never,  ever been used as a meeting place for children or teaching or anything.   We have a visiting bishop who comes for a month or two at a time.  We have --  that' s really all we' ve used it for is a residence.   So, it sits there empty a good part of the time, and occasionally,  we have someone stay there.   That' s it.   It' s a residence.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Do you have anything else, Ms. Russo?\n\nMs. Russo:   Excuse me?\n\nMayor Lago:   Do you have anything else you' d like to say?\n\nMs.  Russo: Yes,  I would just like to say that,  once again,  I think this is a community, a neighborhood issue.   It' s not an issue that should lay solely on the shoulders of St. Philip' s.   I'm aware of the swale package.   In fact, one of the neighbors --  we did have a neighborhood meeting, which the Toyos did not attend,  but the neighbor,  Dr. Forachi ( phonetic)  and the Lopez Cotardi phonetic),  we talked about the ability to landscape your swale since there has been so much use of a public swale.   I happen to live on Country Club Prado,  so I'm well aware how people use swale all the time to enjoy the city park.   And if I were to be so inclined to keep people from parking there,  I could avail myself of this. Deena Bell Llewellyn has done a great job of recommending native plant material and other materials,  you know,  shrubs and up to a certain height, et cetera, and doing this without having to pay for a permit and facilitating the hand drawing of it, et cetera.   And I shared that information with the neighbor who attended the meeting.   So, once again,  I ask you for approval of the building.  We understand the neighborhood dilemma,  but I ask you that we join as neighbors to try to figure out the problem and not lay it solely at the feet of a nonprofit that is not increasing students,  okay?   Because if in fact there were an increase in students,  I would be saying,  yeah,  we' re going to have a bigger impact.   I think we should do something,  but we' re not.   And I know the school complies with the affidavit as do the other schools with respect to the student cap.   So, you know, we do not want to enlarge the school.   We want to keep it a very small neighborhood school.   And again,  it's been there for 70 some years.\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   Thank you very much.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes, Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: So, long before I ran for office, I dealt with parking issues in neighborhoods, in our neighborhood. I live within a block of Le Jeune Road. There was a construction project coming in of a multi-story building on Le Jeune Road and spoke to neighbors, and we came up with a resolution and the neighbors voted to have --  one neighbor wanted grass put in, but we went with residential parking permit signs.   I warned my neighbor who parked all the time on his swale that his grass would not live, and it didn' t.  Because once you start driving on it, it dies.   The heat of the engine,  the wear and tear in the car, you have to irrigate it,  all those things go into grass or any planting.  And then we have other areas in our city that have high traffic. We have Venetian Pool, the Biltmore Hotel,  around the United Congregational Church of Christ. They have high traffic as well.  My neighborhood still had high traffic.   In fact, I had MercedesBenz employees parking at my property instead of them paying for parking for those folks.  So, I had a few words with Mercedes- Benz.   I said, I'll be darned if I'm going to pay for parking of my employee so they can park at the building and you' re burdening my property with all your employees.   So, there are solutions.   And I'd like to hear --  you know, I'd like for our Landscape Division to go out there and discuss some of the solutions with you all because,  if you want landscaping,  you' re going to lose parking.   If you want landscaping to live, you have to water it. You have to realize now you' re not going to have the parking.   But there are other solutions if you do want parking for yourself,  for your guests,  such as we have the fancy coquina,  the nice gravel, all part of the swale package.   There are items in the swale package you can put in that require less water,  but I wouldn' t say that they need no water.   You have to get them established. And you can' t be parking on top of them,  you know.   One of the challenges that one of our residents has met is he put in landscaping and still, you know, people don' t care and they roll over it because it' s not their property.   So,  once upon a time,  we required FP&amp; L and Comcast to put plantings around their boxes.  Slowly but surely, that has come and rests upon the shoulders of the residents. I think if you want a planted swale,  you need to make some decisions on what you want,  because you' re going to have to maintain it.   Because if you don' t irrigate it,  you can' t expect it to live.  So, take a look at the residential parking permit program.   The residential parking permit signs are much,  much prettier.   Each one of us gets some emails from particular residents that don' t like parking signs.  They consider them ugly.  Why do we need all the signs?  We have sign pollution. But the ones that are residential parking permit are green poles,  extruded,  and a much nicer sign and blend in with the community and don' t upset some of those other residents we have in Coral Gables that don' t like ' No Parking' signs.   They call it sign pollution and they want to take the signs out.  In fact, in my neighborhood I'm getting a list of all the ' No Parking'  signs from all the neighbors that want them out so I can just have staff come out one time.  And --  but I would like staff to come out there and help advise between parking programs available. I can tell you the folks that face the Salvadore dog park, we had a long discussion about it.   I told them the options and they said if the parking became an issue on their side,  that they were going to go with the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential parking permit.   That was their choice.   And in closing,  I'll give you the history of the word swale.   I know it's funny.   It's a funny word.   I thought it was funny because no one else spoke it except for me at one point in time until I moved into Coral Gables.   And I learned that the etymology of it, at least locally here in the United States,  came from Pittsburgh.   And it's not a hidden fact that George Merrick came from the Pittsburgh area, the Philadelphia area.   And that is a word that was brought over from, you know, UK English descent type word.  So, you won' t find it heavily used outside of Coral Gables. It was transplanted here from the Northeast and they called it Pittsburgh- ese.   You can look at --  get a dictionary of Pittsburgh- ese and find it.  So\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Anybody else?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I do have a couple of comments. I'm in the area quite a bit during pickup and drop-off.  And I have to agree,  during drop-off, the park should not be an issue.   The park is not heavily used at drop-off time.  During pickup,  I do see your argument that the park is heavily used in the afternoon.   A lot of parents pick up their children from other schools and bring them to the park.   I think that' s something that as we continue to renovate our City parks and improve the City parks in other areas,  including Phillips Park,  hopefully beginning next year,  we will see some shift in that use,  but it is something that must be addressed. Because just seeing your pictures,  I've seen the cars parking in the swale every morning,  and I've seen the effect that it has on residences. Like Vice Mayor Anderson stated,  I myself have been a victim of people parking and blocking my driveway on a regular basis because of a business at the end of my block. So, I have seen that impact,  and in some cases,  we' ve tried to get the people to move and they just refused to do so.   We' ve had to call the police in order to get them out and remove them from blocking driveways.   What I would have liked to have seen prior to this is some sort of resolution between the school and the neighbors,  instead of having to get to this point where now we' re basically airing the neighborhood laundry here in the City Commission.   Between first and second reading,  like the Mayor said,  I think there needs to be a sit down and some sort of resolution between both sides on something that will work going forward.   If the plans are to expand,  I do have concerns because there is no parking there and that will be something that must be addressed. But I think the Mayor brought up a very good point of including the Manager in this conversation and the City Attorney,  because I think it' s also encumbered upon us in the City if we have made all these improvements on Salvadore Park,  that we are not creating more problems for the neighbors in the area and that we are part of finding a solution.   So, I think it' s something that we need to work together,  City,  the school,  and the neighbors on finding a solution that works for everybody.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner Menendez.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Thank you, Mayor.   Speaking of Salvadore Park,  I drove by the other evening,  and I noticed a great many cars parked,  I guess,  next to the dog park.   Is that --  have we\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nalways had folks parking --?   Because it' s not --  it' s dirt basically,  between the playground area and the dog park.  I just see there are parks there --  cars everywhere parked.   I don' t know if that' s officially a parking spot or\u2026\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' re looking --  I've already talked to -- after the dog park we opened the dog park, I noticed that that was a mud area,  and I've already talked to Public Works about changing that into some type of rock, like a granite, so that it can be used as a parking area,  yet not turn it into asphalt.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Okay,  because it is pretty clear that people are looking for parking spots where there aren' t any.   And I don' t recall in the past seeing cars there.   I too have --  I feel the same way.   The project in and of itself,  I think it' s a wonderful project,  well presented,  well thought out for all the right reasons,  but the fact that the different parties haven' t come to a meeting of the minds taints the whole process. We should be here celebrating a wonderful project that everybody can embrace,  but unfortunately,  there are a lot of loose ends.   So, that' s not a positive, not only with this item,  but with any item that comes before the City Commission. We' ve had plenty of items that just seem to sometimes unravel because one string is loose,  they pull and everything comes apart.   So, let' s try to avoid that.  I have a couple questions for, I guess,  the City Attorney.   Is -- so, the number of students that are allowed,  let' s start there.   That' s written where in terms of\u2026\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  In their prior approval,  and there' s a recorded covenant as well.  So --  and they' re not asking for an amendment to that or a change in connection\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And I understand.\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:  With this amendment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Exactly. And I'm not saying they are or that they will,  but to understand the legal ramifications of that agreement or that document,  what happens if a school does expand?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  They would have to come before you and request that. You would all review it and request approval of an amendment to their prior approvals.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And if we find out that they' ve added a hundred more students or 50 more students,  then what would the City have?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   So, they have to -- and maybe the planner can come up, but I think annually they submit an affidavit.   Isn' t that\u2026?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   City Planner,  Jennifer Garcia.   So,  they --  I believe they submit something every single year, every single school year to\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   I think it's done toward the middle of September.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:  ( INAUDIBLE)  every January.\n\nMs. Russo:   January.\n\nCity Planner\n\nGarcia:   January,  okay.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:   We send a letter ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Right.\n\nMs. Russo:   Right,  each school has it a little bit differently. I think some have it at the end of September,  but all the schools I've represented that have student limitations provide an annual affidavit on the student enrollment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   So, it's a viable legal binding agreement.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   Correct.   And if there was a violation,  then we would take action to enforce the covenant is what we would do.  That would be our recourse.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: And I agree,  there are other schools,  I know the charter school on Segovia,  when they were approved,  all the schools have their limitations.\n\nMs. Russo:   Gulliver,  St. Thomas also have student\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   But I know people are watching,  they want to know, well, is it binding? So, that' s good to know.  In terms of the footprint of the school,  Madam City Attorney,  when 2002 there were agreements,  things that were approved,  was the footprint of the school limited in any documentation?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  So, there is a site plan that was approved.   This is one of the buildings that is part of that site plan that it was --  the existing structure is smaller than what they are proposing. They' re proposing to demolish the existing building within the site plan and construct a larger building.   Is that accurate?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   How about the building itself?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   The building itself is the same size.   The extra square footage comes from the now enclosed concrete walkway for security purposes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I'm talking about the campus.\n\nMs. Russo:   Those of you with small children know that you can' t -- you don' t want access to children.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   So,  this -my understanding is that this request does not change the boundaries of the site plan.\n\nMs. Russo:   That is correct.   The boundaries remain the same.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   My follow-up question,  and I totally understand having a property that people can --  visitors can stay, you know, close to the school,  the church.  When they acquired that property --  and I totally support and understand having it for guests --  did that change the footprint of the campus,  or is that something they should have notified the City that we' ve added a property?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  No, they have a right to purchase and own property.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   It has --  it is not connected to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.   Right, and no, I just want to check off the boxes.\n\nMs. Russo:   Yeah,  to connect it, let' s just say,  we' re not going to do it, but let' s just say,  it would have to come before DRC, it would have to go before the Planning and Zoning Board, and it would be a change in land use and a change in zoning and a major amendment to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Like I said,  the fact that you' re not having classes or events,  it's --  I understand the need for it.  I just don' t want to cross that line at any point because it' s not good for the school,  the church,  or the City in general,  or obviously,  the residents.   I totally support the direction my colleagues are headed with between first and second reading.   I personally suggest don' t bring this back on second reading unless there' s a true agreement because we don' t want to repeat today.   And with regards to signage,  the residential permit,  I asked the City Manager,  that area does qualify for it, but again,  things have to be enforced and we all know because we have traffic circles,  we have speed bumps,  sometimes physical additions are required because people just regardless of what the sign says,  do whatever they want.   So, I'm in support of the direction my colleagues are headed with this first to second reading.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay,  so we can close this out between first and second,  if I'm getting the vibe of what this Commission is headed. So,  we' re going to move forward on first reading.   To move forward,  obviously,  we' re going to take a vote now.   What we' re requesting between first and second is -- okay, would you like to say something?\n\nMs. Russo:   No, no.\n\nMayor Lago:   No, I just want to make sure.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'm just acknowledging that we' re going to be meeting with the City Attorney and City Manager.\n\nMayor Lago:   What I would like is for there to be a meeting between the applicant and the City, the City Attorney,  City Manager,  and yourself,  if any other residents would like to join, to make sure that we address the issues with the swales.   What are we talking about?   A swale package of one form or another,  or what the Vice Mayor said in regards to the opportunity to address resident parking,  which has to be enforced.   Again,  that puts another burden of proof on you, because I'll tell you why.   Because you have to call --  if someone parks there,  you have to call and get it enforced.   When you have the swale package in place, you' re not calling anybody because no one, unless they' re, you know,  destructive individuals and they park over the swale package,  I don' t think many people are going to park over that.  At least in my yard, which I have the swale package, the ferns,  you can' t park on the swale.   There' s no opportunity.   But if you really wanted to, you could.  You would potentially get your car stuck in there.  So, my point is that we' re going to move forward between first and second reading,  but there will be a meeting where you will be there.  I'm also asking for the Manager and for his team to please pick a day that they do not notify the applicant during school hours to make sure that we visit and we understand exactly what' s happening,  either during drop-off and pickup,  to get a better understanding of where we are right now in regards to what they' re facing in that neighborhood.   Are there anything else that we need to add as requests between first and second?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   With those conditions,  I would move it.  You know, they need to have a meeting also with our staff to understand what the choices are on these residential parking permit signs because then you have a decal or a paper that goes in on the car and someone will be ticketed if you call if they park there without having that permit sign.  So, make sure you study your choices so you can make the best informed choice.   You know, everybody likes something different.   We don' t all like the same flavor of ice cream.   So, really,  the choice is in your --  on you.\n\nMayor Lago:   The goal...\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we didn' t want to be here.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But the reality is that we' ve reached out ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   I think I'm going to think the words out of your mouth.   The intent of today is to turn a new leaf and hopefully start building a relationship between the school and yourself that is something where you can become partners.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' re open to it.\n\nMayor Lago: Become partners because you' re not going anywhere, the school' s not going anywhere,  the park' s not going anywhere.   So, what we need to do is work together so that we just continue to advance quality of life in the neighborhood.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Agreed.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think Ms. Russo had a comment from a resident that you want to maybe deliver.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, that was Ed Diaz and I told him, he came up with an idea and I said let' s save that for when we all meet.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just wanted to make sure\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   Together.\n\nMayor Lago:   We put your idea on the record and please.\n\nMs. Russo:   He' s the chief operating officer, so he deals a lot with the parents and asking them not to park on swales ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   We welcome all ideas between first and second.   So, I need a motion,  if I may.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I'll move it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Second.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes. Commissioner Castro:   Yes. Commissioner Fernandez:   Yes. Commissioner Menendez:   Yes. Mayor Lago:   Yes. Vote:  5-0)\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Do you know when this will be coming back,  Mr. Manager?   Do you know when this is coming back?\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   So, it'd be, I think, up to the applicant when they' re ready to come back, as long as we have time to provide mail notice.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think we need to work on a few things before bringing it back.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  I think one meeting is going to be a little bit too quick.\n\nMs. Russo:   Right, I think --  I was going to say,  I think we should make it for the second meeting in February\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Perfectly\n\nfine.\n\nMs. Russo:   To give us enough time\u2026\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think so.\n\nMs. Russo:   With all our different schedules.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   I think that would be --  I think second meeting in February is right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Because I think that we can\u2026\n\nMs. Russo:   Right, second meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think we can potentially resolve this, find middle ground with those signs that the Vice Mayor mentioned could be really --  could really be an opportunity to really resolve it.   And any --  and again,  now' s the time to address other issues that are both beneficial for the school and for yourself.   And maybe the City can do better in that area.   Maybe we can be a better partner in one form or another.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   If we go the route of the signs,  I'll tell you right now, the signs --  and the reason I smile is because the signs are being used with tape lines to hold barricades that are not supposed to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:   And that' s what we' re going to -- and that' s what we' re going to talk about.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   And they' re not being enforced.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: That' s why I said to meet with the Landscape Department. They' re fabulous.   We have a nice swale package.\n\nMs. Russo:   And maybe someone from Parks and Rec could also be at the meeting\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Good idea.\n\nMs. Russo:   Since\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nMs. Russo:   Along with the City Manager and the City Attorney.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Manager will make sure that his team is there.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Well, I think we cannot leave Salvadore issue --  park issue out, so I expect them to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.  So, we' ll --  then we' ll be hearing you from the end of February,  correct?\n\nMs. Russo:   The end of February,  yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   That gives enough time to have meetings and everything like that.\n\nMs. Russo:   Perfect.\n\nMayor Lago: Alright,  we' re going to take a five-minute break so everybody can go to the bathroom.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   And then we' ll be back for E-8.  Thank you.\n\nMs. Russo:   Thank you, thank you.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024",

I was not exactly thrilled by our decorations on Miracle Mile this year.  I think we can do better.  I know that we did approve a budget for it. I know that there were issues with the timing and with storms and the lighting,  but I would like to see going forward and I did receive some complaints from residents about the decorations on Miracle Mile.  I would like to see this central avenue in our city be highlighted which ends at the Menorah that the Mayor purchased,  our Santa which is over 60 years old, and the park that we have every year and our Christmas Tree. I think it's important that Miracle Mile be highlighted going forward.  So that' s what I would like to see going forward,  it's just an improvement.  I know that we did in the past rely on the BID for some of this as well, but I think I would like to see an improvement.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago: Mr. Manager,  if I may. Belkys, you and I have talked on multiple occasions in regard to we received some emails and some kudos from business owners and people who have visited in regard to how much better the holiday decorations looked this year in comparison to past years, correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago: Just to give a little bit of background,  because I know that two of the Commissioners were not here when this happened.  When the BID was basically removed from the picture,  we were in the process of working with them to come to an agreement and we had to scramble to pick up the pieces.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  We had two weeks to put it together.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two weeks.  Your team did a wonderful job,  along with the Manager.  This was basically like a dry run the first year. In regard to the Santa Clause,  you want to replace the Santa Clause.  I probably received five emails from people saying that the Santa Clause is historic and don' t touch my Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Who wants to replace it?\n\nMayor Lago:  I don' t know. I'm just telling you. You said something about the 60-year-old Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, I said leading up to it. We should make sure that the avenue leading to all of our historic decorations and the Menorah,  it needs to measure up, because\u2026\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I thought you wanted to replace the Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Not at all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I just love him.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There was a request to render it historic and to that point,  I think we need to do something to protect it, because it' s kind of just out in the open on a corner.  We need to make sure there' s something in front of it protecting it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Besides that. How much did we spend on the park in the last three years?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  On the park or on Miracle Mile?\n\nMayor Lago:  No, no. Miracle Mile is another thing. On the park.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I don' t know.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  I know it was a big investment.  Mr. Manager,  we hadn' t changed the decorations in decades,  correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  We changed it about three years ago and we are up on the new contract now.\n\nMayor Lago:  But what was the number,  it was massive.  We spent a lot of money.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  I think it was 250, 300, something like that\u2026\n\nMayor Lago: We spent a lot of money on the park and obviously,  we' ve also spent,  how much did we spend on Miracle Mile so far?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Miracle Mile and Giralda for the holiday decorations, 147,000 and my budget was $150,000.\n\nMayor Lago:  Did we buy these ornaments,  or these were just rented?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez: There' s only a certain portion which was bought. Basically,  they were hand made for us, so the ornaments that are hanging from the trees and the ones that are on the median,  the stars that are on the median,  that is the only thing that we will continue with for the next three years.  So, two more years we' ve got of that. And then everything else,  so about $ 64,000, we have the ability to go out and we are going to go out to get bids for the rest of those decorations.  We did that because we, you know, I hear you Commissioner,  but I think decorations are really subjective.  Some people could like it, some people not,  and so we really wanted to start with a pallet where you could see decorations.  Last year the ones that we had were one ornament per block,  that' s the only thing we were able to get, and it was lit at night as well, also had a lighting component to it, but there was only one per block. I really don' t think that was enough for the street.  I don' t think it was significant enough for the type of street that we have.\n\nMayor Lago: If I may, if you would educate the Commission.  Over the last few years, we' ve been talking about the lack of lighting,  full-time lighting throughout the year of the oak trees,  and obviously,  Christmas Tree lighting.  That to me, has been,  I think is priority number one.  When you talk about Christmas -  the ornaments are beautiful,  I want to see lights.  I want to see lights hanging from the oak trees.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  You mean like the full year.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  I wouldn' t have an issue with it. I don' t have an issue with it. But that' s something that people have talked to me about it,  and it makes a lot of sense.  We could do something beautiful,  well done, tasteful,  doesn' t have to be bright neon.  It could be a softer color, but I think that it would benefit the street significantly and it would give a festive kind of feel to it throughout\n\nCity Commission Meeting the year.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  The lighting is really what detracted from the decorations,  because you couldn' t even see them. The stars on the palm trees, I was hard-pressed to find them, because you could see where they were.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  At night.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  So, two things.  The string lights that are on the trees that are on Miracle Mile, the swales,  they are currently lit only up to the trunk.  So, this was a project that was put in place to replace those,  that was a project that had been started by the former Business Improvement District.  They paid 50 percent of it. We are picking it up as part of the budget process.  We did ask for the $79,000 that it would cost to complete that project,  and so,  I did receive that.  That is going to be a project that' s going to start in February.  We didn' t want to do it in the middle of the holiday season,  because we weren' t sure when it would be done, and so because our budget just started in October,  we wanted to have enough time to be able to have it. So that' s a year- round lighting that would be installed,  and we have talked to that vendor,  and they know that they need to go up some of the branches.  I'm not sure how many string lights were purchased,  because it' s not our project,  but we want to go up.\n\nMayor Lago:  But this is something that we' ve been talking about,  Commissioner,  for two years. I know the BID fell apart and everything that happened,  but I want to make sure that we deliver on that this year, if possible.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I had a lot of feedback and even in our comments in the community and I think the Mayor was touching upon it. I would love to have Miracle Mile be a go-to place in the holiday season for folks to come to Miracle Mile to see.  In my perfect world, Miracle Mile should glow during the winter, during the holidays,  glow, and people like, hey, let' s drive to Coral Gables Miracle Mile so we can just see how beautifully lit and create sort of a winter wonderland concept. I think that' s what -  without that we can put all the decorations possible on trees and it will look like Charlie Brown' s Christmas Tree which sort of you know,  tips over.  I would like to create, what is it, the wow. I want people to feel wow and the lighting is the key,  I think,  and since the Mayor did mention that we have Commissioner Castro,  Commissioner Fernandez weren' t here when the whole BID, not now, but could you or somebody maybe in February give a history of the responsibilities for Miracle Mile and how we now transition to the city doing it. So,  I think I want to fill in any gaps,  because now, obviously,  we' re tasked with it and we all want to put our best foot forward,  but if you could do just a brief how we got here, that would be helpful.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  So, I'm going to dovetail. As I handed out to you, this was a communication with residents,  and it was on Next-door, so I want to make sure\u2026\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Very popular topic on Next-door.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I make sure I put my communications back to the residents.  What they would like, the main complaint there was lack of color.  This was an invitation that I sent to them to participate and there is a willingness of residents to participate,  but our history on trying to do something with Miracle Mile goes back when the BID was here,  Slesnick came in and visited every single one of us who was in office at the time,  basically imploring us to dress up Miracle Mile. I brought in pictures from Winter Park' s main drag,  showing what they had done.  People want some color, people want some flash to show there, but we don' t want it too bright either.  So, maybe I don' t know if we need to dim down some of the other lights so that the decorations are the showcase.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  No sunglasses needed.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No sunglasses needed.  So,  some of those vertical poles when we talked about Calvin rating, I don' t know if we can either through a film or something to kind of tone them down a little bit so its not hard to look at, so that the lights on the trees and the decorations on the trees are the center of focus,  as opposed to the glare that you get from some of the lights on the Mile in one corner and some of the crosswalk areas.  So, I just wanted to share this communication with you all, with the residents,  they are interested in participating.  You might get a reach out from them saying,  here' s our ideas and we all collaborate and get a better pizza, so-to-speak.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I also think it' s important to keep in mind that while we want something at night, we do need to get a good bang for our dollar too, and make sure that they are really impactful in the daytime.  Just keep that in mind as well,  because we do have a big population in the daytime,  and we want to make sure that they enjoy it also.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Thank you.",

You might get a reach out from them saying,  here' s our ideas and we all collaborate and get a better pizza, so-to-speak.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I also think it' s important to keep in mind that while we want something at night, we do need to get a good bang for our dollar too, and make sure that they are really impactful in the daytime.  Just keep that in mind as well,  because we do have a big population in the daytime,  and we want to make sure that they enjoy it also.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Thank you.",

Mr. Clerk,  moving on to Item E-8.  Commissioner Fernandez,  this is your item.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  Mayor,  E-8 is an ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107,  real estate for sale, lease, or rental of property or buildings to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease,  or rental of property or buildings in any use district;  providing for severability clause,  repealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date.  This is a public hearing item.  I've asked the Deputy City Attorney to please explain what the proposed ordinance sets forth.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: So,  just a little on the --  on the background on why I put this on the agenda.   It came from a resident who had asked me, why is there a difference between the size of signs that are allowed in residential neighborhoods versus in commercial?   And started looking into it and started driving around downtown Coral Gables and I did see how some of these signs are pretty large and you have windows that just --  just have the sign up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Oh, you need to rewind it right now.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yeah,  start all over?  So\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Take it back.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   If we are take --  if we are doing so much to ensure the beautification of our Central Business District and our business area of our city,  we invest so much time in ensuring that we have the right window coverings,  I think it' s important to also reduce the size of some of these signs that are being placed on windows,  some of them for an extended period of time when they are for management companies,  just to ensure that we maintain a uniform look, if we' re talking about uniform look for our lights as well,  uniform look for our signs.   I did have conversations with a few commercial real estate agents before putting this item on the agenda.  The general consensus I got from them --  and I know there are differing opinions because we have received some emails from realtors about this item -- but the general consensus was that they have not seen a lot of clients lately that have just been driving around the city or walking around looking for property.   Most commercial clients have a realtor that they' re familiar with or that they use, and they work with them to find the property.  So, the larger signs are not necessarily as important.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Throckmorton: Thank you,  Commissioner. So,  just to give a brief overview,  as you mentioned,  just to give us the specifics here,  actually,  currently signs in SFR, MF1,  MF2, MF3, and MF4 districts shall not be larger than 40 square inches with an additional\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nbottom sign with certain language.   And then signs in MX1, MX2, MX3 districts shall be no larger than 250 square inches.   So, this would change the requirement for those MX1, MX2, and MX3 districts from 250 inches down to the 40 square inches that is permitted in those more residential neighborhoods that we discussed.\n\nMayor Lago:   Would you like to hear public comment or would you like\u2026\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   For the Commission first?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Let' s go ahead and do public comment.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   First speaker\n\nis Sarah Hernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Chair, good to see you.\n\nSarah Hernandez: Thank you. Mr.  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  the Commissioners, thank you for allowing me to stay here today and give you the opinion of the business community as through the lens of the Chamber.   As you know, the Chamber only became aware of this ordinance late Friday. It has significantly hampered our ability to speak to our members and see how it' s going to affect their businesses. These include companies like the Allen Morris Company,  Terranova,  Davis &amp; Young,  as well as the Miami Association of Realtors,  the Commercial Alliance.   We believe we have previously addressed this issue for available retail space in our downtown area when we worked together with you over a year ago on the window wrap ordinance for leasable space.   That took into account the signage for the brokerage and the property owners as well.   We have also learned that the commercial brokers are required to list specific information on their signs,  and by reducing the signage from the 250 to the 40 is going to hamper their ability to stay in compliance with the DBPR.   Finally,  even in this day and age of leasing and selling commercial properties, it' s critical that available space be advertised in the window,  especially ground floor retail space. We spoke with our City consultant,  Midge McCauley,  who reiterated this need and the fact that the 250 square feet inches on these signs are small,  less obtrusive than you might see in other municipalities.   We would simply ask for more time to present to our Real Estate Committee and to our business members what the Commission is proposing and allow us to look at the pros and cons and work together to find a solution that would work for the City.  Of course,  we want the City to maintain and continue to be beautiful,  but we' d also like to make sure that we' re not impacting the economic engine,  which is the business community.   Thank you so much for your time, for listening to me, and for your consideration.   Thank you.\n\nCommissioner\n\nCastro:   Thank you.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-8 - Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables official Zoning Code,  amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107 ' Real Estate,  For Sale, Lease or Rental of Property or Buildings,' to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease, or rental of property or buildings in any use district.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Manny Chamizo.\n\nMayor Lago:   Good morning,  sir.\n\nManny Chamizo:   Good morning.  Echoing --  good morning, Commissioner,  Mr. Mayor.  Echoing my oldest friend...\n\nMayor Lago:   Can you put your name and address on the record?\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Sure,  Manny Chamizo,  1507 Sunset.   My oldest friend,  not because I'm old, it's because we' ve been friends since second grade.   Great,  great presentation.   Echoing exactly what Sarah had mentioned,  for me, it's --  sign pollution is critical.   I get it.  You drive around the City, other cities,  and you see billboards,  eight by 10, huge billboards.   I don' t see that issue here in Coral Gables.  To your point, Commissioner Fernandez,  as a commercial practitioner for 38 years, I can tell you that the signage is important.  It's important to identify the buildings,  especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   I'm not sure who you spoke to.  Most of the dominant players, I know who they are, and not all property is listed on the internet.   Sometimes you have to walk it and see it, especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   It' s not as, fortunately,  it' s not like residential real estate where it's a little bit more specific.   Vehicle count is very important.   Foot traffic is important,  parking is important.   So,  there' s a number of other things.   So,  my biggest question is what' s the specific reason? I mean,  other than the fact that I'm cognizant of the pollution,  I mean,  these signs are 12 by 10, whatever the number of square inches are, and you' re having this reduced to the smaller version or proposing to have it reduced.   I'm wondering with the hundreds and hundreds of other signs that I see that are billboard size signs,  including the wrapping of the outside of these buildings when they' re supposed to be temporary,  but I see them being there permanent,  what' s the impetus?   I'm just wondering,  and I'll say it in a simpler,  why pick on us?  I'm asking you specifically,  it's your --  it's your --  it's your\u2026\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Yeah.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And you' re entitled to an answer.   It's really not picking on anybody. I think it' s just about uniformity.  It has worked in the residential space for years.  I don' t remember the date that I was given as to the change when it was made for the residential signs,  but most of the traffic that' s in front of our businesses,  which are blocked by parking, is pedestrian traffic.  So, your --  the argument could be made that you' re closer to the sign,  so a smaller sign should not have that much of an impact.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMr. Chamizo:   That argument,  unfortunately,  doesn' t hold true in a commercial space.   I mean,  as it is, we all wear glasses,  I'm getting older.   I can hardly see the little ones as it is right now.  So, and if you see the font on my phone,  you' ll see that it's huge.   You can probably read it from the dais.   Moving forward,  I think that echoing what Sarah had mentioned is, I believe that although it' s well thought out and I believe that your intentions are good,  I believe that you need a little bit more input from the community and understand,  having done this long enough,  I can tell you that I don' t like anyone stepping on my toes if it's something like this where it could impact our business.   So,  again,  I thank you all for your time.  I'll make it brief.  Let' s reconsider.   Let' s get the input from the community and move forward.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Thad Adams.\n\nMayor Lago:   Good morning,  sir.\n\nThad Adams:   Mr. Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  Commissioners,  it's a pleasure to be here.   My name is Thad Adams, 121 Alhambra Plaza, here on behalf of the Chamber as well, as immediate vice chair, and also happen to be like Manny,  35 years as a commercial real estate professional here,  along with 10 years of experience at the Beacon Council as an officer as it relates to economic development.   And so, we just had a nice chat out there.   I appreciate the goodwill and the intent, Commissioner Fernandez,  of you trying to make the City Beautiful more beautiful.   But there are some things,  had I not been in this business for so long, that may seem intuitive,  but they' re not, as Manny had spoken.   So, we actually believe that this is an 84 percent reduction in the sign.  So, you' re going from --  you' re really going to a postcard.   And real quick,  as we discussed,  people think signs are obsolete and that everyone uses the internet and the listing services. That is absolutely not true.   I have had multiple clients of mine that actually drive --  yeah,  even if I do a survey,  they' re still going to drive and make sure --  and there are properties that have signs.   And it' s mainly the small businesses that don' t know how to put their property on the internet,  on CoStar,  on LoopNet.   They' re the ones that rely on those signs more than any of them,  than any other business.   So, I think it' s very important.   And I'll tell you that the City of Coral Gables is already known to have the most stringent sign code of any municipality in Miami-Dade County and beyond.   We are in a competitive market right now.   We are fighting to make sure that we maintain as much occupancy of our buildings,  which is in the best interest of everyone,  including our --  and drive our economy and City revenue. And to take away any aspect of marketing a property,  in my mind, will result in the potential of a reduction there.   And then further,  unlike -as Manny had mentioned,  you would think residential is the same as commercial.   It's not true.  It is a completely different world of being a residential broker and a commercial broker.   And unlike\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential rental and sales signage that has worked with the postcard size, commercial real estate signs are materially more important to business and property owners.   And again,  most of these are small businesses. Many tenants and buyers actually,  as mentioned,  drive through the City. And so,  again,  I respectfully disagree that the proposed ordinance' s stated business impact of essentially limiting how many business users of these such real estate signs.  I do think it will hurt our economy,  have that potential to do so.   It is something that doesn' t just affect the real estate community. You have tenants that have space that need to sublease their space. It' s their responsibility to sublease their space. If they don' t sublease their space,  especially in a timely manner,  it can damage that business. So,  there are direct implications to the business impact in this.   So, I know we would, as a Chamber,  would like to have ample time to vet this, six months or whatever the appropriate time is, and then come back and then let' s see what the impact is and let' s have more edification on this before we move forward.   Thank you for your time and for hearing my comments.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, sir.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:   Anyone else in the Commission?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes, I\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes, Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I just learned about this item really when it was published,  you know, to be able to actually take a look at the language.   Language does matter.   I don' t think there' s been adequate time to weigh the compliance requirements of the DBPR,  the Department of Business Professional Regulation.   I'm looking up some of it right now, versus the impact on the commercial real estate individuals who do this as a profession. But I do know from my experience dealing with commercial leases and entities that have to do the subleasing and so forth,  and my own experience going around and looking for commercial space,  I'm walking and looking for these signs and to have these little postage stamps on there,  especially when you' re talking about,  you know, requirements,  how many square feet, you know, am I even interested in looking at it, type of thing,  is a tremendous impact on the ability not only for practitioners to be able to do the marketing,  but also for the customers themselves.   Like, if I'm looking for new office space,  where am I going to go look?  I'm going to be walking in an area that I want to be in.  I'm very particular because I like to walk to my office.  So, you know, that' s how sensitive some of these issues are. Or you want to be near a different type of business because you don' t want to have too many restaurants next to each other.   You want to go walk that area and see how many restaurants are there.  Is there a clothing store there?  Is the clothing store wanting to be near the restaurant because the traffic that goes to the restaurant is going to be browsing then the clothing and going and buying that.   So,  the walkability of the area and the parking,  et cetera,  is a critical,  critical issue.   So,  I\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nrespectfully ask for this one to be postponed until another meeting later so that we can have additional input.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   When I had this item -- discussed it on agenda review, I had a difficult time grasping visually the difference in the two sizes.   I think staff has examples of what one is. No, just if you want to go up there so everybody can see the difference in size.   Because I was trying to size up a TV, you know.  Thank you, I appreciate it.   It' s good to know.  Sometimes it' s important to have visuals.   You did very good, you can do Wheel of Fortune one day.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   It's excellent,  great idea.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Vanna White.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, Belkys.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I spoke to a few folks in the commercial real estate industry.   That was a pretty good line.   And they made a comment,  a thought that,  and it probably holds true.   First off, what department in the City is tasked with making sure signage is the right size?  Do we have a --?\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:  Code --  that would be Code Enforcement,  sir.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   It would be Code Enforcement.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   It would be a Code Enforcement violation to violate our sign ordinance.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Because one thought was that it's possible that folks are putting signs actually bigger than what is allowed.   And if that' s the case,  we may first want to make sure -have Code Enforcement spend a couple of months trying to see how many businesses are using signage above and beyond what' s already allowed.   Because what I'm hearing is the folks in the industry want to keep it as is.  They' re not saying let' s go bigger.   But if some are going bigger, they' re tainting the businesses or the reputation of what' s happening by those that are abiding by the law.  So, my preference would be to see --  have Code Enforcement see what they can find out in terms of are folks actually going above and beyond what' s allowed.  If that' s the case, why don' t we crack down on those individuals and then come back and see if that perhaps helped the situation that,  you know, perhaps is out there.   That' s my take.   Thank you.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' ll be happy to have Code Enforcement look at it, and they do enforce it when it's --  basically,  the residential is 4 by 10\u2026\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   And the commercial is 16 by 16 inches or just a hair below that.  And they should be enforcing that,  but we' ll make an issue and we' ll\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   The fact that it's now a discussion publicly,  you know, we all -- Code Enforcement,  we all handle a million things.  And sometimes it' s --  you know, we shine a light on an issue.   Let' s focus on that issue and see what we come up with.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner,  do you have any comments?\n\nCommissioner Castro: Yes,  I wouldn' t be opposed to giving them a little more time for some community input on your Real Estate Committee as well.  And then I guess we could take it from there.\n\nMayor Lago:   So, I just want to talk a few points on this ordinance.   First, I'd like to have Belkys come up for a second so we can kind of compare when we talk about the wrap ordinance.   I know I didn' t ask you to do this before,  I just kind of found out about this ordinance on Friday,  so we really didn' t have much time to really go over it, and I thought about it over the weekend.   I didn' t want to bother you over the weekend. So,  when we talked about the wrap ordinance that I sponsored in 2022,  how long did we work on that,  how much input did we garner from the community?   Because we transformed wraps,  the wraps that we\u2026\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Right, yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   Put on the businesses now.  How did we do that?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   It was a process.\n\nMayor Lago:   To the best that you remember.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I would say probably two to three months that we worked on it and we refined it.   We looked at other communities to see what they were doing.   We talked I personally talked to the City of Miami Beach.\n\nMayor Lago:   We met with Mark Trowbridge.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Obviously,  we involved the Chamber as well.\n\nMayor Lago:   The BID back then.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Yes,  and the BID, because it was --  it was an iteration that we took of the Business Improvement District.   They had a wrap, but we basically wanted to do it citywide also.   So,  it wasn' t just,  you know, the Central Business District or the BID area. So, yeah,  it took a bit.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  and I remember that I also,  if I remember correctly,  and the Clerk can make a public records request,  we also put it as a discussion item to get input from the Commission before we even embarked on the ordinance process to see if there was buy-in.  I try to do that as much as I possibly can just to make sure that if anybody has any input, they can, you know, provide that input and they can --  we can move forward on a process that has some sort of legs before we move further.   I'll give you an example.   So, the faux grass in the front of homes that we see now in driveways.   That was something that I put as a discussion item,  I think probably one or two times.  We brought it on first reading,  and then obviously,  Commissioner Fernandez requested that it go to the BOA.  The BOA was resoundingly in support of it, it came back, and it failed with the Commission.   That' s what I would recommend.   I would recommend that,  in my opinion,  is that you get some input from the Chamber,  at a minimum,  the Chamber.   They are the heart and pulse of the business community here.   We have a great Chamber.   Again,  Mark and the Chair to really give some input,  to sit down,  and as a licensed realtor,  I can tell you who has purchased a good amount of commercial real estate,  some of my best finds, some of my best finds have been walking by a property.   And one of the things that we' re not discussing today,  and I can give you examples of that, where both in the City of Coral Gables and outside the City, I've been walking or driving by, and I have found a piece of property where, you know, there was a sign, I hadn' t even engaged LoopNet,  or I hadn' t even engaged the MLS.   That' s number one.   Number two, a lot of people don' t even have MLS.   They don' t.  They don' t want to pay the fee,  it's not a requirement,  and they don' t have LoopNet yet. Another issue that I'm seeing is obviously the DBPR.   This is something that I was researching very quickly.   We, as a Commission,  got multiple emails from realtors and calls in opposition of this.  I didn' t have one person that told me that this was a good idea,  but I'm always willing to look at the other side of the coin if it makes sense.   But one of the things that they brought to my attention was listen,  Vince,  the DBPR has certain language that' s required,  that' s required to be exhibited on the for sale or for lease or for rent signage.   It makes it incredibly difficult to fit all that language on such a small,  you know, little piece of document that is exhibited for sale or for lease.  Another issue that we haven' t discussed,  but I think it's something that you should consider when you' re talking with all these leaders of industry.   I talked to the head of the Real Estate --  South Florida Real Estate Association,  which is located here in Coral Gables,  adjacent to the fire station.   I know that they' re in opposition of this issue.  Was something that I just thought about right now.  What about for sale by owner?  I bought one property for sale by owner from a lady who, in the building that I was living in, I happened to just walk by and she had this sign in the apartment building,  when I used to live in 100 Edgewater,  over a decade ago. So, I happened to walk by, she was selling it for sale by owner,  I negotiated with her, and I ended up buying the property.   How are we going to address for sale by owner signage,  which I think is something that needs to be considered,  because when you go to, let' s say, Home Depot,  or you go to OfficeMax,  I haven' t been there in a while, but they sell for sale by owner signs.   You can order\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nthem online.   You just have to put your information on it, and how will we address that?   So,  to me,  I think that what I would recommend is that you go back and we speak with multiple community leaders to find a way to bridge the gap and to better understand what are the benefits of this ordinance?   What are we going to get out of it?   Because when we talk about sign pollution, and I'm a huge proponent of it, I've driven with Code Enforcement probably four or five times to try to remove as many signs as possible throughout the City on the trolleys.  I think there' s always an opportunity to reduce sign pollution.   And we have a resident who, I'm not sure if he copies everyone here,  but he probably does,  who sends us probably on a weekly basis signs that are throughout the City that are, you know, blank because of sun exposure that serve no real purpose, three signs in a one-foot radius that make no sense.   And so, I think there' s an opportunity,  but this is a little bit different.   Let us not forget,  let us not forget that when you' re talking about the City of Coral Gables,  our Central Business District accounts for almost 40 percent of our tax base.   So, we need to be very, very, very thoughtful and very methodical when we make certain changes to how people can access the sale and lease of real estate properties here in Coral Gables.   I mean,  I commend you for bringing this forward,  but I think there has to be a lot more discussion,  a lot more opportunity to flush this out.   And as I think as probably the only licensed realtor on this Commission,  I think we really should always engage South Florida real estate community,  the Chamber,  any other community that engages in the sale or transaction of real estate.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   I appreciate the input from my colleagues and from those in the room. I think the reason that a lot of the members of the community and the Commission only learned of this on Friday is because of the timing of the holidays and the release of the agenda.   It's something I've been working with staff since the end of last year.   So, it isn' t something that has just come about in the last few days.   That being said, I think I'm always one to get more input and be open to getting community input on these issues.   And Madam Chair,  would you be willing to host a meeting of your realtors and members of your --  of the Chamber who are willing to sit down and have a conversation with me to discuss potential changes and how we can improve the signage in the Central Business District?\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Okay.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   And I will say something.   I think (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Chair, please come before us, please.\n\nMs. Hernandez: I will say that I think that what Commissioner Menendez said,  it could be that there' s a lot of people breaking the law and not going through the ordinance that is causing,  you know, somebody to come to you and kind of complain.   So, I think I'd be very interested to see what that,  you know, report comes up.   But absolutely,  we will host this and we will bring our community leaders to the table to speak with you.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Okay.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   And anyone else who would like to join.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   So, I would like, if we can do it in the next 30 days,  just to have that conversation.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   I know staff will be working on the Code Enforcement portion of it so that we can,  when we bring it back,  we can have your input taken into account as well.   I know Mr. Trowbridge also told me he wanted a little more time to have conversations with the members. So, always willing to listen to what our business community' s needs are.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Thank you, Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And thank you, Mr. Chamizo and Mr. Adams for being here as well. And the members who actually --  who sent emails.\n\nMr. Chamizo:  One final item,  Manny Chamizo,  once again. Echoing Commissioner -Kirk' s comment,  there are a number of signs that are currently out of compliance. I can tell you,  I've been here 41 years, I'm sure you' ve been here just as long.  Neon signs, you know that neon signs are not supposed to be on the windows.   They' re there.   I mean,  I see them.   They' re supposed to be, I believe, you can correct me if I'm wrong, I believe it has to be six feet from the actual window. You can have neon, just can' t have it up in windows.   There are hundreds of violations.   So, that' s why I'm kind of like, hey man, what happened?   You know, why are we --?   Are we going to go out there now, we' re going to go with, you know, an actual measuring stick and start measuring if we are two inches above or one quarter of an inch, because there' s so many violations.   So, I think that the first thing,  if you want to start cracking down on signs,  start cracking down on all signs. And then we can start focusing in on the commercial real estate signs,  which may or may not be in compliance.   Thank you again.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I mean,  well,  I appreciate that.   And I think that Code Enforcement should do a better job of enforcing.   I think that the conversation here is specifically about the real estate signs and I think the focus of what Commissioner Menendez was saying was about the real estate signs.   So, that being said,  I guess I'll defer the item.\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay, thank you.  Moving on to -- thank you for being here.   I appreciate it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024",

Mr. Clerk,  moving on to Item E-8.  Commissioner Fernandez,  this is your item.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:  Mayor,  E-8 is an ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107,  real estate for sale, lease, or rental of property or buildings to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease,  or rental of property or buildings in any use district;  providing for severability clause,  repealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date.  This is a public hearing item.  I've asked the Deputy City Attorney to please explain what the proposed ordinance sets forth.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: So,  just a little on the --  on the background on why I put this on the agenda.   It came from a resident who had asked me, why is there a difference between the size of signs that are allowed in residential neighborhoods versus in commercial?   And started looking into it and started driving around downtown Coral Gables and I did see how some of these signs are pretty large and you have windows that just --  just have the sign up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Oh, you need to rewind it right now.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yeah,  start all over?  So\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Take it back.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   If we are take --  if we are doing so much to ensure the beautification of our Central Business District and our business area of our city,  we invest so much time in ensuring that we have the right window coverings,  I think it' s important to also reduce the size of some of these signs that are being placed on windows,  some of them for an extended period of time when they are for management companies,  just to ensure that we maintain a uniform look, if we' re talking about uniform look for our lights as well,  uniform look for our signs.   I did have conversations with a few commercial real estate agents before putting this item on the agenda.  The general consensus I got from them --  and I know there are differing opinions because we have received some emails from realtors about this item -- but the general consensus was that they have not seen a lot of clients lately that have just been driving around the city or walking around looking for property.   Most commercial clients have a realtor that they' re familiar with or that they use, and they work with them to find the property.  So, the larger signs are not necessarily as important.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Throckmorton: Thank you,  Commissioner. So,  just to give a brief overview,  as you mentioned,  just to give us the specifics here,  actually,  currently signs in SFR, MF1,  MF2, MF3, and MF4 districts shall not be larger than 40 square inches with an additional\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nbottom sign with certain language.   And then signs in MX1, MX2, MX3 districts shall be no larger than 250 square inches.   So, this would change the requirement for those MX1, MX2, and MX3 districts from 250 inches down to the 40 square inches that is permitted in those more residential neighborhoods that we discussed.\n\nMayor Lago:   Would you like to hear public comment or would you like\u2026\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   For the Commission first?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Let' s go ahead and do public comment.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   First speaker\n\nis Sarah Hernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Chair, good to see you.\n\nSarah Hernandez: Thank you. Mr.  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  the Commissioners, thank you for allowing me to stay here today and give you the opinion of the business community as through the lens of the Chamber.   As you know, the Chamber only became aware of this ordinance late Friday. It has significantly hampered our ability to speak to our members and see how it' s going to affect their businesses. These include companies like the Allen Morris Company,  Terranova,  Davis &amp; Young,  as well as the Miami Association of Realtors,  the Commercial Alliance.   We believe we have previously addressed this issue for available retail space in our downtown area when we worked together with you over a year ago on the window wrap ordinance for leasable space.   That took into account the signage for the brokerage and the property owners as well.   We have also learned that the commercial brokers are required to list specific information on their signs,  and by reducing the signage from the 250 to the 40 is going to hamper their ability to stay in compliance with the DBPR.   Finally,  even in this day and age of leasing and selling commercial properties, it' s critical that available space be advertised in the window,  especially ground floor retail space. We spoke with our City consultant,  Midge McCauley,  who reiterated this need and the fact that the 250 square feet inches on these signs are small,  less obtrusive than you might see in other municipalities.   We would simply ask for more time to present to our Real Estate Committee and to our business members what the Commission is proposing and allow us to look at the pros and cons and work together to find a solution that would work for the City.  Of course,  we want the City to maintain and continue to be beautiful,  but we' d also like to make sure that we' re not impacting the economic engine,  which is the business community.   Thank you so much for your time, for listening to me, and for your consideration.   Thank you.\n\nCommissioner\n\nCastro:   Thank you.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-8 - Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables official Zoning Code,  amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107 ' Real Estate,  For Sale, Lease or Rental of Property or Buildings,' to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease, or rental of property or buildings in any use district.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Manny Chamizo.\n\nMayor Lago:   Good morning,  sir.\n\nManny Chamizo:   Good morning.  Echoing --  good morning, Commissioner,  Mr. Mayor.  Echoing my oldest friend...\n\nMayor Lago:   Can you put your name and address on the record?\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Sure,  Manny Chamizo,  1507 Sunset.   My oldest friend,  not because I'm old, it's because we' ve been friends since second grade.   Great,  great presentation.   Echoing exactly what Sarah had mentioned,  for me, it's --  sign pollution is critical.   I get it.  You drive around the City, other cities,  and you see billboards,  eight by 10, huge billboards.   I don' t see that issue here in Coral Gables.  To your point, Commissioner Fernandez,  as a commercial practitioner for 38 years, I can tell you that the signage is important.  It's important to identify the buildings,  especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   I'm not sure who you spoke to.  Most of the dominant players, I know who they are, and not all property is listed on the internet.   Sometimes you have to walk it and see it, especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   It' s not as, fortunately,  it' s not like residential real estate where it's a little bit more specific.   Vehicle count is very important.   Foot traffic is important,  parking is important.   So,  there' s a number of other things.   So,  my biggest question is what' s the specific reason? I mean,  other than the fact that I'm cognizant of the pollution,  I mean,  these signs are 12 by 10, whatever the number of square inches are, and you' re having this reduced to the smaller version or proposing to have it reduced.   I'm wondering with the hundreds and hundreds of other signs that I see that are billboard size signs,  including the wrapping of the outside of these buildings when they' re supposed to be temporary,  but I see them being there permanent,  what' s the impetus?   I'm just wondering,  and I'll say it in a simpler,  why pick on us?  I'm asking you specifically,  it's your --  it's your --  it's your\u2026\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Yeah.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And you' re entitled to an answer.   It's really not picking on anybody. I think it' s just about uniformity.  It has worked in the residential space for years.  I don' t remember the date that I was given as to the change when it was made for the residential signs,  but most of the traffic that' s in front of our businesses,  which are blocked by parking, is pedestrian traffic.  So, your --  the argument could be made that you' re closer to the sign,  so a smaller sign should not have that much of an impact.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMr. Chamizo:   That argument,  unfortunately,  doesn' t hold true in a commercial space.   I mean,  as it is, we all wear glasses,  I'm getting older.   I can hardly see the little ones as it is right now.  So, and if you see the font on my phone,  you' ll see that it's huge.   You can probably read it from the dais.   Moving forward,  I think that echoing what Sarah had mentioned is, I believe that although it' s well thought out and I believe that your intentions are good,  I believe that you need a little bit more input from the community and understand,  having done this long enough,  I can tell you that I don' t like anyone stepping on my toes if it's something like this where it could impact our business.   So,  again,  I thank you all for your time.  I'll make it brief.  Let' s reconsider.   Let' s get the input from the community and move forward.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Thad Adams.\n\nMayor Lago:   Good morning,  sir.\n\nThad Adams:   Mr. Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  Commissioners,  it's a pleasure to be here.   My name is Thad Adams, 121 Alhambra Plaza, here on behalf of the Chamber as well, as immediate vice chair, and also happen to be like Manny,  35 years as a commercial real estate professional here,  along with 10 years of experience at the Beacon Council as an officer as it relates to economic development.   And so, we just had a nice chat out there.   I appreciate the goodwill and the intent, Commissioner Fernandez,  of you trying to make the City Beautiful more beautiful.   But there are some things,  had I not been in this business for so long, that may seem intuitive,  but they' re not, as Manny had spoken.   So, we actually believe that this is an 84 percent reduction in the sign.  So, you' re going from --  you' re really going to a postcard.   And real quick,  as we discussed,  people think signs are obsolete and that everyone uses the internet and the listing services. That is absolutely not true.   I have had multiple clients of mine that actually drive --  yeah,  even if I do a survey,  they' re still going to drive and make sure --  and there are properties that have signs.   And it' s mainly the small businesses that don' t know how to put their property on the internet,  on CoStar,  on LoopNet.   They' re the ones that rely on those signs more than any of them,  than any other business.   So, I think it' s very important.   And I'll tell you that the City of Coral Gables is already known to have the most stringent sign code of any municipality in Miami-Dade County and beyond.   We are in a competitive market right now.   We are fighting to make sure that we maintain as much occupancy of our buildings,  which is in the best interest of everyone,  including our --  and drive our economy and City revenue. And to take away any aspect of marketing a property,  in my mind, will result in the potential of a reduction there.   And then further,  unlike -as Manny had mentioned,  you would think residential is the same as commercial.   It's not true.  It is a completely different world of being a residential broker and a commercial broker.   And unlike\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential rental and sales signage that has worked with the postcard size, commercial real estate signs are materially more important to business and property owners.   And again,  most of these are small businesses. Many tenants and buyers actually,  as mentioned,  drive through the City. And so,  again,  I respectfully disagree that the proposed ordinance' s stated business impact of essentially limiting how many business users of these such real estate signs.  I do think it will hurt our economy,  have that potential to do so.   It is something that doesn' t just affect the real estate community. You have tenants that have space that need to sublease their space. It' s their responsibility to sublease their space. If they don' t sublease their space,  especially in a timely manner,  it can damage that business. So,  there are direct implications to the business impact in this.   So, I know we would, as a Chamber,  would like to have ample time to vet this, six months or whatever the appropriate time is, and then come back and then let' s see what the impact is and let' s have more edification on this before we move forward.   Thank you for your time and for hearing my comments.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, sir.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:   Anyone else in the Commission?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes, I\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes, Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I just learned about this item really when it was published,  you know, to be able to actually take a look at the language.   Language does matter.   I don' t think there' s been adequate time to weigh the compliance requirements of the DBPR,  the Department of Business Professional Regulation.   I'm looking up some of it right now, versus the impact on the commercial real estate individuals who do this as a profession. But I do know from my experience dealing with commercial leases and entities that have to do the subleasing and so forth,  and my own experience going around and looking for commercial space,  I'm walking and looking for these signs and to have these little postage stamps on there,  especially when you' re talking about,  you know, requirements,  how many square feet, you know, am I even interested in looking at it, type of thing,  is a tremendous impact on the ability not only for practitioners to be able to do the marketing,  but also for the customers themselves.   Like, if I'm looking for new office space,  where am I going to go look?  I'm going to be walking in an area that I want to be in.  I'm very particular because I like to walk to my office.  So, you know, that' s how sensitive some of these issues are. Or you want to be near a different type of business because you don' t want to have too many restaurants next to each other.   You want to go walk that area and see how many restaurants are there.  Is there a clothing store there?  Is the clothing store wanting to be near the restaurant because the traffic that goes to the restaurant is going to be browsing then the clothing and going and buying that.   So,  the walkability of the area and the parking,  et cetera,  is a critical,  critical issue.   So,  I\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nrespectfully ask for this one to be postponed until another meeting later so that we can have additional input.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   When I had this item -- discussed it on agenda review, I had a difficult time grasping visually the difference in the two sizes.   I think staff has examples of what one is. No, just if you want to go up there so everybody can see the difference in size.   Because I was trying to size up a TV, you know.  Thank you, I appreciate it.   It' s good to know.  Sometimes it' s important to have visuals.   You did very good, you can do Wheel of Fortune one day.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   It's excellent,  great idea.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Vanna White.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, Belkys.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I spoke to a few folks in the commercial real estate industry.   That was a pretty good line.   And they made a comment,  a thought that,  and it probably holds true.   First off, what department in the City is tasked with making sure signage is the right size?  Do we have a --?\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu\u00c6rez:  Code --  that would be Code Enforcement,  sir.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   It would be Code Enforcement.\n\nCity Attorney Su\u00c6rez:   It would be a Code Enforcement violation to violate our sign ordinance.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Because one thought was that it's possible that folks are putting signs actually bigger than what is allowed.   And if that' s the case,  we may first want to make sure -have Code Enforcement spend a couple of months trying to see how many businesses are using signage above and beyond what' s already allowed.   Because what I'm hearing is the folks in the industry want to keep it as is.  They' re not saying let' s go bigger.   But if some are going bigger, they' re tainting the businesses or the reputation of what' s happening by those that are abiding by the law.  So, my preference would be to see --  have Code Enforcement see what they can find out in terms of are folks actually going above and beyond what' s allowed.  If that' s the case, why don' t we crack down on those individuals and then come back and see if that perhaps helped the situation that,  you know, perhaps is out there.   That' s my take.   Thank you.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' ll be happy to have Code Enforcement look at it, and they do enforce it when it's --  basically,  the residential is 4 by 10\u2026\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   And the commercial is 16 by 16 inches or just a hair below that.  And they should be enforcing that,  but we' ll make an issue and we' ll\u2026\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   The fact that it's now a discussion publicly,  you know, we all -- Code Enforcement,  we all handle a million things.  And sometimes it' s --  you know, we shine a light on an issue.   Let' s focus on that issue and see what we come up with.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner,  do you have any comments?\n\nCommissioner Castro: Yes,  I wouldn' t be opposed to giving them a little more time for some community input on your Real Estate Committee as well.  And then I guess we could take it from there.\n\nMayor Lago:   So, I just want to talk a few points on this ordinance.   First, I'd like to have Belkys come up for a second so we can kind of compare when we talk about the wrap ordinance.   I know I didn' t ask you to do this before,  I just kind of found out about this ordinance on Friday,  so we really didn' t have much time to really go over it, and I thought about it over the weekend.   I didn' t want to bother you over the weekend. So,  when we talked about the wrap ordinance that I sponsored in 2022,  how long did we work on that,  how much input did we garner from the community?   Because we transformed wraps,  the wraps that we\u2026\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Right, yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   Put on the businesses now.  How did we do that?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   It was a process.\n\nMayor Lago:   To the best that you remember.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I would say probably two to three months that we worked on it and we refined it.   We looked at other communities to see what they were doing.   We talked I personally talked to the City of Miami Beach.\n\nMayor Lago:   We met with Mark Trowbridge.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Obviously,  we involved the Chamber as well.\n\nMayor Lago:   The BID back then.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Yes,  and the BID, because it was --  it was an iteration that we took of the Business Improvement District.   They had a wrap, but we basically wanted to do it citywide also.   So,  it wasn' t just,  you know, the Central Business District or the BID area. So, yeah,  it took a bit.\n\nMayor Lago:   Yeah,  and I remember that I also,  if I remember correctly,  and the Clerk can make a public records request,  we also put it as a discussion item to get input from the Commission before we even embarked on the ordinance process to see if there was buy-in.  I try to do that as much as I possibly can just to make sure that if anybody has any input, they can, you know, provide that input and they can --  we can move forward on a process that has some sort of legs before we move further.   I'll give you an example.   So, the faux grass in the front of homes that we see now in driveways.   That was something that I put as a discussion item,  I think probably one or two times.  We brought it on first reading,  and then obviously,  Commissioner Fernandez requested that it go to the BOA.  The BOA was resoundingly in support of it, it came back, and it failed with the Commission.   That' s what I would recommend.   I would recommend that,  in my opinion,  is that you get some input from the Chamber,  at a minimum,  the Chamber.   They are the heart and pulse of the business community here.   We have a great Chamber.   Again,  Mark and the Chair to really give some input,  to sit down,  and as a licensed realtor,  I can tell you who has purchased a good amount of commercial real estate,  some of my best finds, some of my best finds have been walking by a property.   And one of the things that we' re not discussing today,  and I can give you examples of that, where both in the City of Coral Gables and outside the City, I've been walking or driving by, and I have found a piece of property where, you know, there was a sign, I hadn' t even engaged LoopNet,  or I hadn' t even engaged the MLS.   That' s number one.   Number two, a lot of people don' t even have MLS.   They don' t.  They don' t want to pay the fee,  it's not a requirement,  and they don' t have LoopNet yet. Another issue that I'm seeing is obviously the DBPR.   This is something that I was researching very quickly.   We, as a Commission,  got multiple emails from realtors and calls in opposition of this.  I didn' t have one person that told me that this was a good idea,  but I'm always willing to look at the other side of the coin if it makes sense.   But one of the things that they brought to my attention was listen,  Vince,  the DBPR has certain language that' s required,  that' s required to be exhibited on the for sale or for lease or for rent signage.   It makes it incredibly difficult to fit all that language on such a small,  you know, little piece of document that is exhibited for sale or for lease.  Another issue that we haven' t discussed,  but I think it's something that you should consider when you' re talking with all these leaders of industry.   I talked to the head of the Real Estate --  South Florida Real Estate Association,  which is located here in Coral Gables,  adjacent to the fire station.   I know that they' re in opposition of this issue.  Was something that I just thought about right now.  What about for sale by owner?  I bought one property for sale by owner from a lady who, in the building that I was living in, I happened to just walk by and she had this sign in the apartment building,  when I used to live in 100 Edgewater,  over a decade ago. So, I happened to walk by, she was selling it for sale by owner,  I negotiated with her, and I ended up buying the property.   How are we going to address for sale by owner signage,  which I think is something that needs to be considered,  because when you go to, let' s say, Home Depot,  or you go to OfficeMax,  I haven' t been there in a while, but they sell for sale by owner signs.   You can order\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nthem online.   You just have to put your information on it, and how will we address that?   So,  to me,  I think that what I would recommend is that you go back and we speak with multiple community leaders to find a way to bridge the gap and to better understand what are the benefits of this ordinance?   What are we going to get out of it?   Because when we talk about sign pollution, and I'm a huge proponent of it, I've driven with Code Enforcement probably four or five times to try to remove as many signs as possible throughout the City on the trolleys.  I think there' s always an opportunity to reduce sign pollution.   And we have a resident who, I'm not sure if he copies everyone here,  but he probably does,  who sends us probably on a weekly basis signs that are throughout the City that are, you know, blank because of sun exposure that serve no real purpose, three signs in a one-foot radius that make no sense.   And so, I think there' s an opportunity,  but this is a little bit different.   Let us not forget,  let us not forget that when you' re talking about the City of Coral Gables,  our Central Business District accounts for almost 40 percent of our tax base.   So, we need to be very, very, very thoughtful and very methodical when we make certain changes to how people can access the sale and lease of real estate properties here in Coral Gables.   I mean,  I commend you for bringing this forward,  but I think there has to be a lot more discussion,  a lot more opportunity to flush this out.   And as I think as probably the only licensed realtor on this Commission,  I think we really should always engage South Florida real estate community,  the Chamber,  any other community that engages in the sale or transaction of real estate.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   I appreciate the input from my colleagues and from those in the room. I think the reason that a lot of the members of the community and the Commission only learned of this on Friday is because of the timing of the holidays and the release of the agenda.   It's something I've been working with staff since the end of last year.   So, it isn' t something that has just come about in the last few days.   That being said, I think I'm always one to get more input and be open to getting community input on these issues.   And Madam Chair,  would you be willing to host a meeting of your realtors and members of your --  of the Chamber who are willing to sit down and have a conversation with me to discuss potential changes and how we can improve the signage in the Central Business District?\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Okay.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   And I will say something.   I think (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Chair, please come before us, please.\n\nMs. Hernandez: I will say that I think that what Commissioner Menendez said,  it could be that there' s a lot of people breaking the law and not going through the ordinance that is causing,  you know, somebody to come to you and kind of complain.   So, I think I'd be very interested to see what that,  you know, report comes up.   But absolutely,  we will host this and we will bring our community leaders to the table to speak with you.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Okay.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   And anyone else who would like to join.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   So, I would like, if we can do it in the next 30 days,  just to have that conversation.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   I know staff will be working on the Code Enforcement portion of it so that we can,  when we bring it back,  we can have your input taken into account as well.   I know Mr. Trowbridge also told me he wanted a little more time to have conversations with the members. So, always willing to listen to what our business community' s needs are.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Thank you, Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And thank you, Mr. Chamizo and Mr. Adams for being here as well. And the members who actually --  who sent emails.\n\nMr. Chamizo:  One final item,  Manny Chamizo,  once again. Echoing Commissioner -Kirk' s comment,  there are a number of signs that are currently out of compliance. I can tell you,  I've been here 41 years, I'm sure you' ve been here just as long.  Neon signs, you know that neon signs are not supposed to be on the windows.   They' re there.   I mean,  I see them.   They' re supposed to be, I believe, you can correct me if I'm wrong, I believe it has to be six feet from the actual window. You can have neon, just can' t have it up in windows.   There are hundreds of violations.   So, that' s why I'm kind of like, hey man, what happened?   You know, why are we --?   Are we going to go out there now, we' re going to go with, you know, an actual measuring stick and start measuring if we are two inches above or one quarter of an inch, because there' s so many violations.   So, I think that the first thing,  if you want to start cracking down on signs,  start cracking down on all signs. And then we can start focusing in on the commercial real estate signs,  which may or may not be in compliance.   Thank you again.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I mean,  well,  I appreciate that.   And I think that Code Enforcement should do a better job of enforcing.   I think that the conversation here is specifically about the real estate signs and I think the focus of what Commissioner Menendez was saying was about the real estate signs.   So, that being said,  I guess I'll defer the item.\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay, thank you.  Moving on to -- thank you for being here.   I appreciate it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024",

By the way,  thank you for being here and reviewing the proposal.  I appreciate that.  I know you' ve got a lot on your plate and that was sent to you late. I thought it was sent to you before.  I would have removed it off the agenda if we weren' t ready for it, my fault. I apologize.  I know you guys rushed it to take a look at that. So, moving onto item F2. You want to just kind of put Pittman Park to rest.  I think we have a graph there,  not a graph, excuse me, a diagram.  We can show Pittman Park, something that I would love one day to be able to embark on,  but I'm just a little bit concerned about whether it' s even viable.  Due to several different things that are kind of in conflict;  number one, the neighboring building,  the alley, trying to close that street and connect the park.  Is there anybody from staff that can show this? Do we have anybody from staff?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  the Public Works Director is - he' s coming up now. I'm sure he' s coming up from the conference room.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. We' ll come back to it.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  He' s right here.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  He' s running up the stairs.\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. Caught you off guard there.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Catch your breath.\n\nMayor Lago:  I gave a preamble that this is not a -  this is a beautiful project,  if we can get it to work, but its not really going to work.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: My apologies.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Its okay. We' re just trying to make sure you get your steps in.\n\nLaughter]\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Yes. Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  Mr. Director,  I was explaining that Pittman,  the idea of bringing Pittman Park into Giralda is a beautiful thing, along with the surface parking lot, but there are many conflicts.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Correct.\n\nMayor Lago: The building, the alley, and it just kind of makes the idea and concept a little difficult.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Public Works Director Diaz: So just a little back story.  The current plan, which is not funded due to cost,  its some improvements to the parking lot behind the Giralda Plaza to match the existing pattern,  right. There are also to be some electrical improvements that will allow that park to on an event put some bollards close off the parking lot. I think it's some upgrade electrical so you could potentially put some, maybe some musical equipment,  that' s the original plan. This plan has been completed;  it's done.  The current estimated -  the last estimate that we have for this, which goes back to March of 2023 was $ 940,000,  so obviously, we haven' t been able to fund this.  So subsequently,  there was a discussion about the potential of joining Pittman Park with the parking lot and obviously there' s, like the Mayor mentioned,  there' s a number of conflicts,  especially you do have an alley,  which we need to make sure that we maintain access to, and the building next door has several entrances and exits that need to be maintained.  So, in a kind of general form, you know, there' s a potential to close the space in between,  as you can see on the picture, on the image, while still maintaining access to the property and to the park.  Obviously,  at some point,  if this is something that moves forward,  the county is going to have to get involved,  the county has to allow for the street to be closed.  There' s the potential for some of the signals that may need to be adjusted. If this is something that the Commission desires to move forward with, you know,  we will need about $35,000 for a conceptual layout and $45,000 for a traffic study, just so that we can, obviously\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nthis is a very crude,  we can get some professionals to really tell us what this could be,  and also start having the conversation with the county as to whether they even consider allowing us to do this, right. So, what we need right now is direction from the Commission whether this is something that you would like us to proceed with and obviously we would need the funding so we can start the process.\n\nMayor Lago:  So again,  right now I don' t think it's feasible in regard to funding.  I think this is a great project to do something spectacular,  especially in our downtown,  but unless my colleagues can envision something else and can provide more guidance,  I would love nothing more than to get Pittman Park activated and to do something special there, but with that building right next door, there are very nice ladies who own that building,  but we haven' t even had that conversation with them.  I wanted to talk to the Commission first,  but obviously with a service alley and how we would have to incorporate the service alley and cut it adjacent to the building.  I think it would cut in way too much into the plaza. It's kind of a tough project at the current moment,  but you never know what happens in the future.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: It's a tough geometry for sure.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes, it is. Well said.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think there was definitely an appetite to do something here,  having walked the area. I agree. I just don' t see a way to make it feasible.  The only way that this will work out would be to close down Galiano Street and I don' t think the county would ever approve that. And again,  you have businesses that would be impacted,  the parking garage access.  So,  I think maybe in the future if there' s a way to do something,  it would work. Maybe Parks Department can try to find a way to activate Pittman Park and in next year' s budget find ways to make it a little more attractive to get people out there. It's just a very small space too.\n\nMayor Lago: The play there, again, we' re talking about it,  we might as well dream,  right. The play is to be able to buy the office building.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Right.\n\nMayor Lago:  When it ever does come for sale. One day it will come for sale, maybe 10 years,  15, 20 years,  nobody thought those lots on Granada and Bird would ever come up for sale,  we found them when they went up for sale.  So that is a piece of property that if it did come up for sale,  I think would alleviate a lot of the concerns on the service alley,  because we could potentially do something great there, because I don' t think any 18-wheeler goes all the way deep into that because they can' t make the corner around that building.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Delivery trucks can' t.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  You could do a smaller rotunda there in the back.  You could do a smaller rotunda, you could do something where it goes into in between the larger building and the building that I'm talking about that those two nice ladies own, you could do something there,  but again,  this is just dreaming,  but if you could incorporate that building then you could do something.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: That' s a whole different conversation.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s a whole different conversation.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Absolutely.\n\nMayor Lago:  That is a whole different conversation because you could put a cul-de-sac right in front of that building,  so if cars come you could go,  you could even go into Pittman Park and maybe take a corner of it and do something great.  You would take all those parking spaces on both sides and then you would have more flexibility to do something great.  But I wanted to bring this to your attention because,  if you see opportunities like this, which is something that I'm going to be bringing,  not I'm going to be bringing,  its an applicant that' s bringing a project next month that we' ve been working on for four years,  I mentioned to you before.  If we think a little bit outside the box. This one will cost us money,  but if you think outside the box, there' s opportunities to get partnerships with developers,  landowners,  people who have a vested interest in the city to really do some great things. This is something just to think about for the future,  put it away.  I don' t even want to spend the money on conceptual,  park layout, traffic study, because money is so tight right now that it's not even worth doing it, because it' s not feasible,  not feasible.  Thank you. Hermes,  I appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Manager,  I appreciate you working on that. Thank you.",

This is a public hearing item.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Good morning/ afternoon,  sorry afternoon,  Jennifer Garcia,  Planning Official. So, staff have been requested by the Commission to give a presentation about Live Local Act and its impact on Coral Gables.  We' ll run through some excerpts of the Act,  highlighting different issues and how it impacts Coral Gables and I'll close with legislation that was just read into the record about parking reductions.  If I can have the PowerPoint,  please.  Thank you. So, the Live Local Act also known as Senate Bill No. 102,  became effective July 1st of last year 2023. And the intent is to address the states of portability housing crisis by preempting local zoning regulations.  It also allows access to over $800 million dollars of funding through various financial programs.  So, the city, according to Live Local Act must authorize development at least 40 percent of its residential units to be deemed affordable,  and that' s up to 120 percent of that adjusted median income or AMI, and in developments only allowed to be in our mixed- use districts.  So, we have three mixed- use districts,  MX1, MX2, and MX3, that it will be applicable to, and you can see that on the map here.  The map on the left side is our northern portion of the city, which chose MX1, along 8th Street;  MX3 more or less on Ponce de Leon Boulevard,  a mix of mixed- use districts in our CBD and downtown area, as well as on the map on the right side is our second half of the city and that' s showing mixed-use in our Design and Innovation District,  along U.S.-1, as well as the urban center down by the City of South Miami at Red Road and Sunset.  So affordable is defined by Chapter 420 of the Florida State Statutes to mean the monthly rents, including taxes,  insurance, and utilities cannot cost more than 30 percent of the local median adjusted income ( AMI). In that case it' s Miami-Dade County.  So,  it's not considered for a city where\u2026 is going to be through countywide and that' s according to the Florida State Statutes.  So,  what is affordable?  There is a resource at floridahousing. org that has these rent limits that we' ll be referring to. So, you can see from the snippet here,  that there' s different percentages of the base of the AMI, which in MiamiDade County is 74,700, and what' s highlighted at the bottom is 120 percent of that amount.  So, for example,  a studio in our city could be deemed affordable and would be just over $ 2,100 and that would be the maximum rent that would be allowed.  Another example,  a two-bedroom would be just over $2,700. So, the Live Local Act also automatically approves height through the highest height within one mile. As you know, we have three zoning districts, MX1, 2, and 3, and that limits the heights.  However,  it's preempted that they will have the highest height within one mile. So, these are maps that our amazing GIS team provided for us and it's showing a radius from those MX2 and MX3 districts. MX2 district is a 70-foot height limitation that' s shown in the bluish/ gray color and 150 is the MX3 maximum height,  which is shown in the greenish color.  And then the density is also preempted by the state to be analyzed citywide.  So,  while the height is analyzed within one mile of the development,  the density is analyzed citywide maximum.  So, the maximum density in our city is 125 units an acre,  as our density is calculated by units per acre and the maximum is 125. So, we do have areas in our city that allow for a limited density that is our Central Business District and our Design and Innovation District, and if an affordable housing development would develop in those areas,  they would be allowed to have also a limited density, but not outside.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  If I may, just as a refresher.  There may be a limited density,  but you' re still required to have a limit in regard to the size of the unit, correct.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, all those\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s kind of your bookend.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes.  So,  all those zoning parameters such as FAR,  maximum,  open space\u2026\n\nMayor Lago: You are mentioning limited density and people think, oh my God, you give thousands of units in one building.  You can' t because you end up eating away at the square footage because you have a cap on a minimum size of a unit size.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And parking.\n\nMayor Lago:  And parking,  so you keep going higher and the higher you go you meet the parking requirement,  the parking pedestals eat away.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  So,  the FAR,  the floor area ratio is very important to control how the scale of that development,  because 3.5 FAR, which is our maximum in our mixed- use district is quite limiting when it comes to reaching 190 feet. So, the ACT also preempts the approval process that has to be approved administratively for the density,  the height,  and the land use. So, properties in our zoning code right now, we require a conditional use process for properties that are greater than 20,000 square feet, and now it goes through the Development Review Committee,  the Board of Architects, Planning and Zoning,  and the City Commission. This will also apply for any development that would honor the Live Local Act to go through that process,  but the Commission would consider other zoning code regulations,  such as FAR,  such as open space on the ground level, parking as well, all those other zoning considerations.  The Commission is preempted to have consideration when it comes to use, height,  and density.  And any property that' s less than 20,000 square feet would not require the building peer review process.  It would go through DRC,  our Board of Architects,  and from there go to permitting.  So, in summary,  the preemption is for the use,  the density,  and the height.  The use is for mixed- use districts.  I just went through the map of where those districts are in our urban areas, analyzed citywide and the height is whatever is allowed within one mile of that proposed property.  So,  the legislation before you today is what the Live Local Act is requiring the city to consider and that is a parking reduction within a half-a-mile of the development and the city can define what major transit stop means.  So, the legislation before you is to find major transit stop as a metro station or the intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with frequencies of service intervals of 15 minutes or less,  during morning and afternoon peak commute periods. So, taking a look at the better bus network, there have been some improvements to our bus system,  and so this would apply to Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas,  and Coral Way. Those will meet the kind of high frequency bus routes.  This is the map showing half-a-mile\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nfrom those intersecting points and also including the Metrorail stops. You can see it's mostly along our urban areas and then close to the City of South Miami.  So,  the criteria to request a parking reduction from the Commission would be half-a-mile from the major transit stop. It would have to be an accessible route from one quarter mile of that property of the development and a major transit stop. The Commission would consider any impact that parking reductions may have on a neighborhood and making sure its compatible with the surrounding area and the parking reductions are based on the size of the property.  So, a greater,  larger property would have less reduction and a larger reduction would be for the smaller properties and that would be to discourage larger,  taller buildings that may be out of character with the surrounding area.  And the Commission can also grant any rate of parking reductions that' s less than 6,000 square feet.  And that' s all I have.  So, staff is here, legal is here to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have one question on accessible route.  Let' s say that accessibility is defined as ADA compliant accessibility.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, I think we have, and I can bring it right now that the ordinance had,  sidewalks,  ramps,  crosswalks,  any way that' s easily to get to need proposed development to the major transit stop.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Okay.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I only have a question I brought up at agenda review.  You mentioned trolley stops and bus stops as triggering the need for this legislation or compatibility and I think in the discussion recently the county took away one of our, several bus stops or bus routes that we normally have.  So,  we' ll be passing legislation connected to particular bus stops when bus stops now, we know come and go, but once we approve this reduction in parking, even if those bus stops disappear down the road,  we still have the impact of today' s legislation.  I know we' re bound or required to do it, but its sort of not well thought out in Tallahassee,  but maybe that' s the norm these days.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  That' s the consideration the Commission makes if there' s a proposed development that once a reduction of parking maybe there' s a line that you think is not used that often,  maybe the concern that the county may remove it in the future, that' s up to your discretion.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  Right.  In each instance it will come to you all to consider and approve if that' s the will of the Commission to the parking reduction based on a consideration of the impact of the development on parking and the character of each particular neighborhood.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  And I just want to clarify that the ordinance doesn' t tie a consideration to a specific bus stop,  but it just defines a criteria to determine what a mass transit stop is, and so, if a bus stop is eliminated,  for example,  it wouldn' t require an amendment to the ordinance or to the zoning code, that criteria remain static.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that feedback.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you for the presentation.  You gave a good explanation of what we' re facing with Live Local. Any comments from the public.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Yes sir. We have a member of the public on Zoom who would like to speak is Aky Fernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:  The floor is yours. Good afternoon.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes sir.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Okay. Good afternoon,  everyone,  Aky Fernandez,  1542 Mendavia.  I'm a resident of the city lifelong.  Also, an architect and a builder.  Happy with this proposed legislation.  I think it' s a step in the right direction.  The only thing that I will say after sort of reading through it, you know frankly,  the reductions that are being proposed while I think they are well-intentioned,  I actually don' t think it' s going to go a significant way in terms of making the final product more affordable.  To be frank,  they need to be more generous,  the parking reductions,  if we' re actually going to see some of this inventory get built. I'll give you an example.  I have a project that I'm working on now, 10,000 square- foot project, we can fit anywhere between 15 to 16 parking spaces on that parcel,  surface parking.  You know, under this legislation,  a ten percent reduction would be a space and-a-half, maybe two spaces,  if I get a good interpretation.  That' s not necessarily going to make a huge difference in terms of how affordable the units are going to be.  I think maybe something that would help sort of give some reference is actually a local precedent that we have in Miami-Dade County, there' s something called the Urban Center Program;  and within the Urban Center Program sort of very similar along the lines of trying to give parking discounts for workforce housing along transit,  they basically -  I'm happy to share it with the Clerk and maybe he can distribute it to you all. They have a tiered system which basically gives a by-right workforce reduction of 25 percent and then when you are building within 500 feet of a rail station,  you can actually qualify for up to 100 percent reduction and then it goes in terms of, and then it reduces based on how far you are from a bus stop, etc., goes all the way to ten percent reduction.  And then the way that they do it in terms of parcel size is that parcels less than 15,000 square feet get up to 100 percent reduction,  and then parcel size between 15 to 30,000 feet get a 60 percent reduction; parcels greater than 30,000 get a 20 percent parking reduction.  And that' s kind of the way they do it. It' s just an idea.  I understand that this is a new sort of program that we have to, I think the Commission is obligated to at least try to make some kind of accommodation for parking,  but I think this is a reference that could sort of help guide the conversation.  And I just wanted to share it with you all. Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Aky, thank you. I've had the pleasure meeting with Mr. Fernandez,  a very bright, young architect who has an interesting vision and take on potentially offering affordability in this community,  and he' s doing some interesting projects,  not only locally,  but throughout South Florida.  One of the big issues that we have to find a balance for, and this is something that I' ve\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ntalked to with Mr. Fernandez,  we' ve met on several occasions,  is the issue of finding that balance when you' re reducing parking.  One of the issues that we face today,  as you saw with the school, was,  if you reduce parking and we really don' t have a sufficient transit system,  that' s why years ago, and I lost on this. I advocated and the Commission supported me on a resolution to have actual rail on the south corridor and not to do BRT,  because I knew that the hundreds of millions of dollars that we' re spending on BRT, we're going to fall short on really delivering on worldclass transportation. Now we're seeing that already.  To really be able to provide massive parking reductions like other cities have done, for example,  New York, which some buildings don' t even have parking,  you really have to have a robust transportation system that really delivers on moving people.  Our bus system is not where it should be, number one,  and people are not going to ride, excuse me, not going to ride two or three or four modalities to get to work. What are the modalities? the bus, the people- mover,  the BRT, and then Metrorail.  In certain cases,  people are riding four modalities to get to work, two or three hours to get to work. They are just going to stick with their car.  So,  if we do significant parking reductions,  which again,  I think we need to do in the future, if we' re really going to be able to address the issue of affordability in our community,  especially for teachers,  police, fire, first responders,  the issue has to be where can we deliver on transportation so that people really,  really don' t need to use vehicles.  So,  he has an interesting concept that he showed me which I recommend that you show it to the other Commissioners that deals with Ponce, facing the Metrorail and it would be something interesting if that Metrorail connected to something for example,  Homestead,  FIU, Miami-Dade College,  Miami Beach,  where people could actually ride transportation and use one modality all the way from work and home. I recommend that you meet with him. Pretty sharp guy.\n\nVice Mayor Lago:  So,  I'm going to dovetail what you said,  because I was down there as well pushing for the rail and more recently you know when I had meetings with our state representatives I said, don' t do what California did and we' re going to end up with urban sprawl and no transportation because people will have to have a car to get somewhere.  If you want to have affordable living, you also have to have affordable transportation.  We always expect these transit services to turn a profit and it's just not realistic.  We always have money for asphalt.  We don' t have enough money for putting in rail and some of the feedback I got was, Tallahassee can' t put money into the rail. We' re really dependent upon the TPO and for the county to fund that program and get it to half, because it needs to go where people need to go. You need to go out to FIU, you need to get to the colleges,  you need to get effectively get to the airport,  because our airport rail is not like the one in Atlanta, New York, DC, where you can walk right out from getting your baggage and hop right on. You haven' t taken it, it's eye-opening to take it. It would be very, very patently obvious to you that it's inadequate in our county.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two other points just to add onto that because it' s all intertwined when you talk about the reduction in parking.  We also in this Commission,  before this Commission,  I'm not sure who, the Vice Mayor and the Commission we' re on, but we also wrote a resolution that I asked to oppose the highway that was being proposed from Homestead,  excuse me, Kendall,  I apologize, that would drop off next to my office there near Blue Lagoon.  They were talking about potentially having a savings of six or seven minutes on a commute,  but it was a billion-dollar highway program. We as a city, along with five or six other cities, we were the ones, we wrote the resolution.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nWe went to the county in an effort to stop that - stop that and invest that money in real rail. Invest that money in real infrastructure that will deliver and remove cars from the streets.  And the second point that I think is critical, this is just since we' re talking here amongst the Commission,  we never get to do this, we might as well do it now, I think its important is we have to be very, very strict and we have to oppose moving the UDB line. Do not move the UDB line, to me, its catastrophic. I think we need to go vertical before we do more urban sprawl.  Like you said,  it's all investing. When you move the UDB line, its more asphalt and its more infrastructure that needs to be spent when you should be spending that money in the urban core to really have affordability,  because people are tired of driving two and three hours to work, the cost is significant.  It's interesting.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: During our trip to Tallahassee, we did have a conversation with Commissioner Higgins regarding the county' s plans and the work that they are doing right now to expand the Metro Mover out west to FIU and there was an appetite at the time,  or I guess now from Tallahassee to help fund these projects.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'm going to ask you to clarify, Mover or Rail.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Mover.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s a long route for the Mover.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: It is a long route for the Mover,  but it is something that they are currently have commitments from Washington for funding for. So,  it is something that they are working on, and it looks like it has legs and will be able to move eventually.  There are those on the County Commission and in Tallahassee who are looking to maybe expand even further out west and further southwest,  but it is something that they are currently working on, and they look like they' d be able to get something done in the next couple of years.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Interesting.  My husband worked for the Mover,  that' s basically a bus on top of a platform,  its rubber tires.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s why I'm saying that' s a really long route for them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It is, and I guess that' s the way that they decided to move.  My dad actually was a quality assurance engineer for the Metro Mover for many years.  He worked with our ACM when he was there in transit.  It's definitely not Metro Rail. You can fit a lot less people, but it does have the ability to move a little bit quicker.   That' s the way that it has been explained to me. They' ll have more of them on the route and it's also cheaper to get the actual cars versus the rail cars.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  when I was on the TPO before the city was removed,  because of the census,  I knew that we were doing a people mover to Miami Beach.  I'm going to look up to see,  I'm going\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nto ask our representative,  the Director of the TPO to send me information because I know that they are trying to figure out ways to do it that is more affordable and they think the people mover could be an opportunity to save money,  but if they can get it out to FIU, trust me, it's a gamechanger. So, I want to - I'm going to call our director there and see if she can send us more info. Mr. Clerk anything else,  any other.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Alright. Can I get a motion.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'll move it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'll second.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Yes Commissioner Menendez:  Yes Vice Mayor Anderson:  Yes Commissioner Castro:  Yes Mayor Lago:  Yes Vote: 5-0)",

This is a public hearing item.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Good morning/ afternoon,  sorry afternoon,  Jennifer Garcia,  Planning Official. So, staff have been requested by the Commission to give a presentation about Live Local Act and its impact on Coral Gables.  We' ll run through some excerpts of the Act,  highlighting different issues and how it impacts Coral Gables and I'll close with legislation that was just read into the record about parking reductions.  If I can have the PowerPoint,  please.  Thank you. So, the Live Local Act also known as Senate Bill No. 102,  became effective July 1st of last year 2023. And the intent is to address the states of portability housing crisis by preempting local zoning regulations.  It also allows access to over $800 million dollars of funding through various financial programs.  So, the city, according to Live Local Act must authorize development at least 40 percent of its residential units to be deemed affordable,  and that' s up to 120 percent of that adjusted median income or AMI, and in developments only allowed to be in our mixed- use districts.  So, we have three mixed- use districts,  MX1, MX2, and MX3, that it will be applicable to, and you can see that on the map here.  The map on the left side is our northern portion of the city, which chose MX1, along 8th Street;  MX3 more or less on Ponce de Leon Boulevard,  a mix of mixed- use districts in our CBD and downtown area, as well as on the map on the right side is our second half of the city and that' s showing mixed-use in our Design and Innovation District,  along U.S.-1, as well as the urban center down by the City of South Miami at Red Road and Sunset.  So affordable is defined by Chapter 420 of the Florida State Statutes to mean the monthly rents, including taxes,  insurance, and utilities cannot cost more than 30 percent of the local median adjusted income ( AMI). In that case it' s Miami-Dade County.  So,  it's not considered for a city where\u2026 is going to be through countywide and that' s according to the Florida State Statutes.  So,  what is affordable?  There is a resource at floridahousing. org that has these rent limits that we' ll be referring to. So, you can see from the snippet here,  that there' s different percentages of the base of the AMI, which in MiamiDade County is 74,700, and what' s highlighted at the bottom is 120 percent of that amount.  So, for example,  a studio in our city could be deemed affordable and would be just over $ 2,100 and that would be the maximum rent that would be allowed.  Another example,  a two-bedroom would be just over $2,700. So, the Live Local Act also automatically approves height through the highest height within one mile. As you know, we have three zoning districts, MX1, 2, and 3, and that limits the heights.  However,  it's preempted that they will have the highest height within one mile. So, these are maps that our amazing GIS team provided for us and it's showing a radius from those MX2 and MX3 districts. MX2 district is a 70-foot height limitation that' s shown in the bluish/ gray color and 150 is the MX3 maximum height,  which is shown in the greenish color.  And then the density is also preempted by the state to be analyzed citywide.  So,  while the height is analyzed within one mile of the development,  the density is analyzed citywide maximum.  So, the maximum density in our city is 125 units an acre,  as our density is calculated by units per acre and the maximum is 125. So, we do have areas in our city that allow for a limited density that is our Central Business District and our Design and Innovation District, and if an affordable housing development would develop in those areas,  they would be allowed to have also a limited density, but not outside.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  If I may, just as a refresher.  There may be a limited density,  but you' re still required to have a limit in regard to the size of the unit, correct.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, all those\u2026\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s kind of your bookend.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes.  So,  all those zoning parameters such as FAR,  maximum,  open space\u2026\n\nMayor Lago: You are mentioning limited density and people think, oh my God, you give thousands of units in one building.  You can' t because you end up eating away at the square footage because you have a cap on a minimum size of a unit size.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And parking.\n\nMayor Lago:  And parking,  so you keep going higher and the higher you go you meet the parking requirement,  the parking pedestals eat away.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  So,  the FAR,  the floor area ratio is very important to control how the scale of that development,  because 3.5 FAR, which is our maximum in our mixed- use district is quite limiting when it comes to reaching 190 feet. So, the ACT also preempts the approval process that has to be approved administratively for the density,  the height,  and the land use. So, properties in our zoning code right now, we require a conditional use process for properties that are greater than 20,000 square feet, and now it goes through the Development Review Committee,  the Board of Architects, Planning and Zoning,  and the City Commission. This will also apply for any development that would honor the Live Local Act to go through that process,  but the Commission would consider other zoning code regulations,  such as FAR,  such as open space on the ground level, parking as well, all those other zoning considerations.  The Commission is preempted to have consideration when it comes to use, height,  and density.  And any property that' s less than 20,000 square feet would not require the building peer review process.  It would go through DRC,  our Board of Architects,  and from there go to permitting.  So, in summary,  the preemption is for the use,  the density,  and the height.  The use is for mixed- use districts.  I just went through the map of where those districts are in our urban areas, analyzed citywide and the height is whatever is allowed within one mile of that proposed property.  So,  the legislation before you today is what the Live Local Act is requiring the city to consider and that is a parking reduction within a half-a-mile of the development and the city can define what major transit stop means.  So, the legislation before you is to find major transit stop as a metro station or the intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with frequencies of service intervals of 15 minutes or less,  during morning and afternoon peak commute periods. So, taking a look at the better bus network, there have been some improvements to our bus system,  and so this would apply to Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas,  and Coral Way.

And the Commission can also grant any rate of parking reductions that' s less than 6,000 square feet.  And that' s all I have.  So, staff is here, legal is here to answer any questions you may have.

I advocated and the Commission supported me on a resolution to have actual rail on the south corridor and not to do BRT,  because I knew that the hundreds of millions of dollars that we' re spending on BRT, we're going to fall short on really delivering on worldclass transportation. Now we're seeing that already.  To really be able to provide massive parking reductions like other cities have done, for example,  New York, which some buildings don' t even have parking,  you really have to have a robust transportation system that really delivers on moving people.  Our bus system is not where it should be, number one,  and people are not going to ride, excuse me, not going to ride two or three or four modalities to get to work. What are the modalities? the bus, the people- mover,  the BRT, and then Metrorail.  In certain cases,  people are riding four modalities to get to work, two or three hours to get to work. They are just going to stick with their car.  So,  if we do significant parking reductions,  which again,  I think we need to do in the future, if we' re really going to be able to address the issue of affordability in our community,  especially for teachers,  police, fire, first responders,  the issue has to be where can we deliver on transportation so that people really,  really don' t need to use vehicles.  So,  he has an interesting concept that he showed me which I recommend that you show it to the other Commissioners that deals with Ponce, facing the Metrorail and it would be something interesting if that Metrorail connected to something for example,  Homestead,  FIU, Miami-Dade College,  Miami Beach,  where people could actually ride transportation and use one modality all the way from work and home. I recommend that you meet with him. Pretty sharp guy.\n\nVice Mayor Lago:  So,  I'm going to dovetail what you said,  because I was down there as well pushing for the rail and more recently you know when I had meetings with our state representatives I said, don' t do what California did and we' re going to end up with urban sprawl and no transportation because people will have to have a car to get somewhere.  If you want to have affordable living, you also have to have affordable transportation.  We always expect these transit services to turn a profit and it's just not realistic.  We always have money for asphalt.  We don' t have enough money for putting in rail and some of the feedback I got was, Tallahassee can' t put money into the rail. We' re really dependent upon the TPO and for the county to fund that program and get it to half, because it needs to go where people need to go. You need to go out to FIU, you need to get to the colleges,  you need to get effectively get to the airport,  because our airport rail is not like the one in Atlanta, New York, DC, where you can walk right out from getting your baggage and hop right on. You haven' t taken it, it's eye-opening to take it. It would be very, very patently obvious to you that it's inadequate in our county.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two other points just to add onto that because it' s all intertwined when you talk about the reduction in parking.  We also in this Commission,  before this Commission,  I'm not sure who, the Vice Mayor and the Commission we' re on, but we also wrote a resolution that I asked to oppose the highway that was being proposed from Homestead,  excuse me, Kendall,  I apologize, that would drop off next to my office there near Blue Lagoon.  They were talking about potentially having a savings of six or seven minutes on a commute,  but it was a billion-dollar highway program. We as a city, along with five or six other cities, we were the ones, we wrote the resolution.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nWe went to the county in an effort to stop that - stop that and invest that money in real rail. Invest that money in real infrastructure that will deliver and remove cars from the streets.  And the second point that I think is critical, this is just since we' re talking here amongst the Commission,  we never get to do this, we might as well do it now, I think its important is we have to be very, very strict and we have to oppose moving the UDB line. Do not move the UDB line, to me, its catastrophic. I think we need to go vertical before we do more urban sprawl.  Like you said,  it's all investing. When you move the UDB line, its more asphalt and its more infrastructure that needs to be spent when you should be spending that money in the urban core to really have affordability,  because people are tired of driving two and three hours to work, the cost is significant.  It's interesting.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: During our trip to Tallahassee, we did have a conversation with Commissioner Higgins regarding the county' s plans and the work that they are doing right now to expand the Metro Mover out west to FIU and there was an appetite at the time,  or I guess now from Tallahassee to help fund these projects.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'm going to ask you to clarify, Mover or Rail.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Mover.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s a long route for the Mover.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: It is a long route for the Mover,  but it is something that they are currently have commitments from Washington for funding for. So,  it is something that they are working on, and it looks like it has legs and will be able to move eventually.  There are those on the County Commission and in Tallahassee who are looking to maybe expand even further out west and further southwest,  but it is something that they are currently working on, and they look like they' d be able to get something done in the next couple of years.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Interesting.  My husband worked for the Mover,  that' s basically a bus on top of a platform,  its rubber tires.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s why I'm saying that' s a really long route for them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It is, and I guess that' s the way that they decided to move.  My dad actually was a quality assurance engineer for the Metro Mover for many years.  He worked with our ACM when he was there in transit.  It's definitely not Metro Rail. You can fit a lot less people, but it does have the ability to move a little bit quicker.   That' s the way that it has been explained to me. They' ll have more of them on the route and it's also cheaper to get the actual cars versus the rail cars.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  when I was on the TPO before the city was removed,  because of the census,  I knew that we were doing a people mover to Miami Beach.  I'm going to look up to see,  I'm going\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nto ask our representative,  the Director of the TPO to send me information because I know that they are trying to figure out ways to do it that is more affordable and they think the people mover could be an opportunity to save money,  but if they can get it out to FIU, trust me, it's a gamechanger. So, I want to - I'm going to call our director there and see if she can send us more info. Mr. Clerk anything else,  any other.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Alright. Can I get a motion.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'll move it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'll second.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Yes Commissioner Menendez:  Yes Vice Mayor Anderson:  Yes Commissioner Castro:  Yes Mayor Lago:  Yes Vote: 5-0)",

I think live oaks;  he was talking about the two-degree temperature change would probably kill off most of our live oak trees.  So,  I just wanted to put that on everybody' s radar and maybe have the city have a conversation with Dr. Feely and make sure that if we are changing and doing a tree succession that we do take into account potential changes to temperature to make sure that five or ten years down the road if we do have an impact of a couple of years of two-degree or three-degree change to our temperature,  we don' t lose a lot of our tree canopy.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you respond,  could you give us a little bit of background in regard to the existing tree replacement program that we' ve had going on for the last,  I don' t know,  almost a decade.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Absolutely. Hello Commission, Mayor,  I'm Deena BellLlewelyn,  Greenspace Management from Public Works, for the record. Our current tree succession project we launch every year, we have a Commission- fed budget of $200,000 per year for that tree succession project every year.  Right now, there' s 2023 project is coming out of Procurement.  We intend to award it to the contractor,  hopefully within the next week or two to start replanting 111 total trees,  as part of this year' s project,  and as soon as we finish this one,  we roll right into next year where we already have hopefully 90 to 100 trees ready to plan.  We put this out to bid with contractors,  because the size of the project is large.  So, it buys about 100 trees a year on average.\n\nMayor Lago:  And if you go right now to, I was there last week,  if you go to our Public Works Department where the actual yard, you' ll get to see a lot of the oak trees that are basically ready to be transplanted from that office to the area where they are going to be relocated forever in the city. So, you can see all the trees are basically ready there for the contractor to take them to plant them somewhere in the neighborhoods.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Right. And in our Public Works yard we have about 40 oaks. We' re trying to green them up with more water before we plant them.  They dropped all their leaves,  and they are a little brown for our taste, so we' re waiting for them to green up.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  I used to do that by sinking them in six inches of water or more,  because they can tolerate about six weeks'  worth of being in standing water,  any of the ones that went into shock and then I would see the growth,  but right now they are dropping their leaves anyway.  So, a lot of yellowing there.  Where we have the most heat,  generally, is in our Central Business District.  I've seen some plantings that when they were put in, depending on where the location is, the ones that are more isolated with more asphalt around them and reflection are the ones of course that suffer the most and then some of the others of the same variety of tree have no problem making it. So, its planting,  location,  and conditions,  and soils,  and all those things that go into whether or not they will survive.  So, I did see live oaks out in El Paso when I was there, so I don' t know if its really necessarily the heat level or the lack of a freeze,  I guess some research that someone would\n\nhave to do on whether or not they need a freeze,  but I know that that' s true with many other varieties of trees and why we can' t grow Sycamores down here and so forth.  It's not because it doesn' t get hot elsewhere.  It was 102 degrees in Chicago one year.  It's not the heat so much,  its does that tree require a freeze and where is it planted.  So, it was a brutal summer.  My kids wanted to go shopping.  Is it air-conditioned was the only question I kept asking them.  So,  yes,  looking forward to the trees getting planted.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  So, what I would like to see done is just have a conversation with Dr. Feely and report back to us on what recommendations he would have.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn: Absolutely. I'm familiar with Dr.  Feely' s research. Our arborist,  our senior arborist and I have looked into it. We' ve read his articles.\n\nMayor Lago:  You' ve already incorporated some of his guidance,  right.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Yes. So basically,  just in a nutshell,  I don' t want to take too much time, but this concern is due to climate change.  Any tropical tree species migrating up to different areas and as we have a heat change in temperature,  he was concerned live oaks might migrate further north,  because they are not a tropical species.  But in our tree succession planning and here' s our list,  and also,  we had zoning code changes this year,  it encourages more tree diversity and we' re following a lot more tree diversity and here' s the list if anyone' s interested, but you can see a big variety of different natives,  flowering trees with a few oaks,  because oaks are still very viable today.  They are the most sustainable tree.  Our senior arborist stands by them. They are so resilient in hurricanes.  You can see the longevity of them in urban areas. Look at Coral Way,  they' ve been here 80-100 years.  Today,  they are still viable and so,  the concept of what' s going to happen in the future because of unknown climate change is good research to be familiar with, there are so many different opinions on it. So that' s where we are.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I appreciate it.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Sure.",

Thank you for being here with us.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Good morning,  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  Commissioners,  Mr. Manager,  Mr. Clerk and Ms. Attorney.  I'd like to speak to you today about the issue of streetlights.  I know I have spoken with most of you regarding this issue,  but I'd like to bring up a little something here just to share with you to continue that conversation.  I'll also be back to you later this morning for a resolution, an item by the Historic Preservation Board.  I've put together just a simple citizens presentation here for you, just to go through for a few minutes.  Regarding the streetlights -  streetlights as all of\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nus know are more than just lighting.  It's urban design.  It's decoration.  Its branding.  It' s what our community is. And so, Coral Gables began installing streetlights in the early 1920s as part of its master suburb and the streetlighting was always unique to Miami-Dade County.  Mr. Clerk.\n\n## City Clerk Urquia:  Yes sir.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Mr. Maxwell:  Thank you. There' s a 1923 photo of the Country Club all of us go to and enjoy and this is outside of Le Parc right now, and you can see that those are two streetlights that are not only representative of what we had,  but they were the majority lights throughout the community as Merrick developed it and into the 20s, and even after the city sold the lighting system to FPL in 1926.  You can see here in the commercial district,  there' s a representative streetlight.  All of the streetlights that were put in were called White Way Lights at that time. So,  streetlight was not a term that was generally used.  It was called a White Way Light. And it didn' t matter what kind of light it was. It was a White Way Light because we had white ways. Most of the streets were dark ways. Next please. Thank you. There' s an advertisement in the January 4, 1923, Miami Metropolis, and you can see in the picture there,  Dammers and Gillette,  are advertising the beautiful streets of this city. And what kind of streetlights do they show? - they show the standard city silver streetlight that we have today.  Next please.  At the time that the city was developed and really into the 30s, these were the three standard streetlights that the city seemed to have.  I'm sure that there were others mounted on a wood pole or something,  but this is what we can see mostly in pictures and in correspondence. You can see the Fink light, which surrounds the Douglas Entrance,  and those lights were used at some of the most important places in the city. They weren' t on Coral Way, they weren' t at DeSoto Fountain,  but they were at places like the Douglas Entrance.  You can see the standard metal and then you can also see what I call this transit line fixture. You know, we had a wonderful trolley that went through here, and those lights are attached to the electric lines that the trolley went to. The fountains and all of the monuments and entrances that we have all had the same type of what we call luminaire.  So, you can see that the fixtures in there all match what was there. Everything was silver. Everything had a look so that when you came into Coral Gables you knew that you were in a special place.  Thank you. You can see the transit light after the war over here on Miracle Mile, and then how that Fink light is there at the Douglas Entrance.  The history of the lights is really interesting.  In the 1980s,  right now I had the opportunity to go through the city archives and dig out a bunch of things,  because you know,  we' ve been working on this for ever and ever and ever,  and in 1980,  the city and the Historic Preservation Board identified 21 different types of streetlights in our city. I'm going to show you in just a few minutes almost a dozen.  The City Commission received a report and then discussed,  and I can' t find an action item where they actually adopted it but sought to standardize the streetlights in 1980 and begin working diligently with not only the Historic Preservation Board,  and the Board of Architects and other advisors,  but with the Florida Power and Light Company and Public Works Department.  After a while, about a year, it was an Arcadian fixture, which you can see right here, was selected and it's actually in the catalog of this company and it's called a Coral Gables Light Fixture, and this is the one that' s been in use really since that time. So, they provided this to FPL, told FPL and FPL came back and said the following,  company owned fixtures will normally be mounted on poles of the company' s existing distribution system and serve from overhead wires on request by the customer, of the customer,  the company will provide special poles and underground wires that charges specified below. In other words, this is their rate base.  We all know that FPL has a rate base.  They\n\nhave to go to the Public Service Commission.  They have to take everything that everybody asks them for and then have it approved,  and what we' re asking for is to come back and take a look at that. In 1986 FPL purchased these lights and installed them for us. We don' t have the capability to do it. They first went in on Segovia.  They are still there.  They look great,  haven' t been taken out. And so, this is what we have. The light I'm showing you right now though isn' t on Segovia,  but it' s exactly like the one there. This is over by the Douglas Entrance,  and it was just installed;  and if you look at the ground plan, you' ll see that there' s a new base and there' s the markings out for the new wire. So, they put this in and yet, they are taking out poles exactly like this and putting in black poles which are really not appropriate and haven' t been here.  If you would please.  Thank you.  Being a guy that' s been involved in cities for over 45 years,  I have to have a map,  and so I went around town and the red lines that you see on the map that' s where the silver standard White Way Lights are. Now they are intermixed with some of the Denman Fink lights and I'm thrilled to have those back. That' s just the best thing. I've been advocating that for years.  And Mayor and all of you here on the Commission,  I really applaud your efforts for this. It's so unique and I hope that we take advantage of that and continue to use those lights in even more special places,  but the whole idea here about this is to say look, we have a lot of these things already.  Let' s not change them,  let' s re-enforce it. Let' s also look at and see what we can do to, if you would please go to the next one, to change these streetlights,  because these are the most common streetlights that we have in Coral Gables.  The wood pole that you can see.  The one mounted on a concrete pole or the\u2026 concrete pole. Show the next one please. And then we have other streetlights.  And these other streetlights are generally with the exception of the one in the middle,  and that also happens there too,  are generally a private development,  but they are on city right-of-way.  Why doesn' t the city say hey, we' ve got a brand here, use our streetlights.  You get to put it in, you get to pay for it, but please use ours,  and you can use our great Denman Fink lights if you wish.  Go to the next one please.  We have the one in the middle is about four of them and they are over at the French Village on Hardee.  The one here,  let' s see,  on your right is all throughout the northeastern apartment district,  and they' ve been there since close to dirt, because I remember them there over 40 years ago.  And then the one over here that you see on the far left, that' s the Highway Department and that' s on 8th,  Calle Ocho.  And then if you go to Bird Road,  the Highway Department has another one entirely which we don' t have a picture.  I could go on and on and on. We' ve got lots of these things. But the really cool thing is, when you walk it, when you cross that line from wherever it is, from Dade County or the City of Miami or South Miami, and you come here to this special place, its street jewelry embraces you.  If you would go to the next,  please.  We have a new monument that we' ve put in. We' ve put in the black lights,  nobody really thought about that.  And then we have these other kind of street poles I really like. Those are the ones that should be fixed and there' s quite a few like those ones without hats or ones that are broken,  or they are severely tilted over.  So,  if you would please.  So really,  this is not just about history,  it' s about brand and urban design.  It' s about how we want our city to be and we' re going to talk about this a little bit further, and I highly recommend to the board and I will do it again when I read the resolution that we take a look at this and we do it in a deliberate way, that we take this opportunity to not only continue to brand and make our city great, but also to come up with standards that make it easy for us to not only identify where we are in the community.  No other city, no other area in South Florida has streetlights like we do,  nor the color that we have.  We are unique.  So,  with that I'd really recommend considering this and I look forward to speaking with you again about this issue shortly.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nThank you very much for your attention and thank you for anything.  If you have a question,  I'm happy to answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  I just wanted to say thank you for putting that together.  It took a lot of work. I know you take your time to really make sure you drove home the point of the importance of restoring and reviving our history.  I think we are going to go over it a few times. I think there are two items on the Commission that we' ll hear together that address this issue and I welcome you to come back again.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  I think you' ll notice also from the Commission;  I think we are all on the same page in regard to what we want to see. I just think that we need to bring FPL, which is my understanding that FPL will be attending the next Commission meeting to have a conversation in regard to what can we do to get a little bit of uniformity as we address lights moving forward.  You brought up something that I hadn' t thought about, I think is a great idea is the issue,  as developers continue to build throughout this community in one form or another or we invest in this community,  there should be uniformity on that front,  even if it' s something that' s existing,  we should like we' re doing with the White Way Lights.  We just got back ten,  I was there the other day when they brought them in, and we' re going to get about another eight that are in really good shape that are actually working.  So those again will be refurbished,  and they' ll be put somewhere prominently wherever the Historic Preservation and the Manager deem appropriate, and I think that' s something in the works that shows our commitment.  Now the issue is the standard lights that we really need to focus on and see how we can achieve the goal because the costs are pretty significant.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Mayor,  one of the things that I really enjoy about FPL and I do enjoy FPL, I think it' s a wonderful company and they' ve really proven that they are good community citizens,  but you know I want to bring your attention back to a few years ago when FPL said that it was going to cost $30,000 a house to underground,  and how in recent past, not too long ago, its now not going to cost anything.  So, you know, these things have a way of not only working themselves out, but to the benefit of the entire community making it better.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Mayor Lago:  I think to your point,  and you bring a very good point.  I worked with the Manager for years meeting with the President of FPL on multiple occasions,  to see how we can bridge the gap that we wouldn' t have to go to a referendum vote and have to spend close to, I think it was 275 million dollars to underground here in the city, and we found a way, a compromise and we got that project started last year, and its something that hopefully over the next 10 or 15 years we' ll significantly revamp our infrastructure here in the city. Not only revamp it,  but also make it more redundant and beautify the city,  especially our tree canopy which in some areas is killed or destroyed as a result of power lines that run through them.  So, I agree with you. I just think that this is a process that we have to be honest with ourselves.  It's going to take time. For example,  the White Way Lights that we' re refurbishing now, we had to take out, I think it was a little over $ 2 million dollars from Art in Public Places,  which again,  was something that I didn' t want to do, I didn' t want to do, but I pushed that forward because I think its something important and we can see these lights as, not only historic,  but also as art and we' re able to bridge that gap with the help\n\nof our City Attorney to find a solution for that.  But this is a multi-million- dollar situation that we' re in and we have to have real conversations with FPL and see how we can bridge that gap, and maybe somebody on this Commission needs to be named.  I welcome any of my colleagues, whoever they' d like to name,  so that we can have someone dedicated to work on this issue with FPL to find a solution.  It may take six months,  it may take a year,  or it may be resolved in two weeks,  who knows.  But I think that once we have further conversations with FPL, I think we can find uniformity,  but I agree with you.  Future developments need to come online and find that uniform color that uniform look, so we have something a little bit more standard across the board.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  And if we go back to even replacing some of the lights that have been in, that' s not a problem,  because these lights are reusable, the wiring is reusable, everything. We' ve been through lots and lots of hurricanes on these things and the lights have all been there and they are still there. So, we are having an enjoyable time and our record shows that we' ve had a wonderful conversation as just as you said Mayor, with leadership by the Mayor,  by the Manager,  and by the Commission to do this and this was a multi-year process that previous Commissions, previous Managers,  and all went through to come up with what we' ve got,  and you know it takes a long time to evolve you know, and we' ve evolved into the best city in South Florida, if not the best city in Florida.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you for putting that together.  Mr. Manager.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  we have a complete presentation ready for the next Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And we' ve also asked FPL to join us at the next Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  What I would like to do when we have that presentation for the next Commission meeting,  I know Commissioner Fernandez put the item on the agenda,  I'd like for you to be here, obviously and anyone you' d like to bring that' s part of the board.  That' s one of the reasons why I sponsored the Landmark Advisory Board,  I pushed that forward,  to bridge that gap and to find an opportunity to make sure that we are addressing our landmarks and that they are not falling behind, because I'd rather,  I'd like to have the Landmark making noise, advisory board making noise that these landmarks are falling behind,  we need to address these issues,  and there' s a lot of people on that board that are very, very well versed on issues of historic preservation,  landmark,  we have a great team here. So, I'd like to have you here at the next meeting to make sure that you' re part of the conversation and it should be a conversation that' s had by everybody in this community.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  And it is a conversation,  Mr. Mayor. There' re no accusations of anything.  This is a positive direction for our community that will only make it better.\n\nMayor Lago:  This was started before,  this was started like in, when was the time that this was approved,  this rate.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  But before that, it was like 20 years ago,  wasn' t there a discussion on it, on the light poles? Maybe I'm confused.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  The new rate started about five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  the point is that we' ve got to figure out a solution and find something that' s appropriate and we' d love to have you and everybody else in regard to that conversation.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Mayor,  thank you. Its an honor. Its an honor to be with you and I thank you all for your consideration and your time. Thank you all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'm going to take the moment just for a short advertisement.  My Landmark Advisory Board appointee sent me an email indicating that she needs to step down, so if you know of anybody that is interested in serving,  I'd like to have a reappointment for the next Commission meeting,  so that slot is filled. It's an important board.  This Commission is insistent that we, this is an important issue,  we talked about it during our joint meeting with South Miami about branding, so I'm happy we' re moving forward on this.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think Marlin Ebbert is seeking to be appointed to a board. I think that' s something that might be right in her wheelhouse.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes, probably is. I just got the email yesterday,  so I've been reaching out to various members who are also interested in historic preservation, and Marlin I've known for years.  So, I know she would probably fit well.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Next speaker is Tom Wells.\n\nMayor Lago:  Sir, good morning.\n\nMr. Wells: Good morning.  My name is Tom Wells, I live at 1310 Coral Way in Coral Gables,  and my law firm offices is at 901 Ponce, which is in the American Airlines Building, also in the Gables. I spoke at the Commission meeting on December 12th and was told that the monthly construction schedule for John Bell Construction to complete the renovations of Burger Bob' s be published and accessible to the residents to monitor the progress.  Here' s the page of the construction projects currently on the website.  I'll give that to the City Clerk when I complete my discussion.  It was last updated in May 2023.  There is no reference for Burger Bob' s on that construction page.  In addition,  I can monitor the permit.  The current permit right now is 23-08-1877.   Unfortunately, that only tells me about the inspections.  It doesn' t tell me about the construction schedule.  On the John Bell construction contract,  Section 9.13 requires monthly updates.  And so, it would be good for the residents to understand the progress of Burger Bob' s renovation.  So, I'm just here to request what I requested at the last meeting.  Please post the construction schedule for the residents.  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you. Mr. Manager,  please give us an update in regard to the schedule.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias: Mr.  Mayor,  the scheduled completion is for July 29th of this year, substantial completion.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay. July 29th. City Manager Iglesias:  Of this year.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  And a quick question,  where are we right now? I haven' t driven by in a few weeks,  so I haven' t really seen it. How' s the progress coming along?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  The progress is coming fine. It just started and the progress is fine.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  Can you do me a favor and do the Commission a favor please.  Can we have the construction schedule up online by the next Commission meeting?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  I will check.  I thought it was up already.  We' ve been working on Fire House 4. Fire House 4, the contract was signed Friday.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And so now we're going to jump on this.  The project manager for this project has been out for two weeks on vacation,  so we will take care of that.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, if you may. Good morning.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Good morning,  Martha Pantin,  Communications. We did put the information up on the Parks page.  I will send you all a link and if you would like me to put it in any other location,  we' re happy to do so,  and we did include photos,  as requested by the Commission at the last Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, the schedule is up.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  The information we have is up. I will send you the link shortly to all of you,  so that you can see what we have up;  and obviously,  we are happy to make any changes that you would like, and if you would like us to put it in another location,  we can do that as well.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Can we put it on the Home Page?\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Pardon me.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Can we put it on the Home Page?\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  On the Home Page,  we can put it under News. We cannot put it as one of the five things, but we can put it definitely under the News section.\n\nMayor Lago:  Do we have a Burger Bob' s section right now?\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  No, we do not have.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm going to make it even easier.  What I would like to see is, for example,  we use a system in construction called Pro Core. We' re not going to put a Pro Core for access.  But what I would like to see is, there is going to be a link, drop box where people can go in there and see the schedule for the project,  construction,  and monthly update photos. Maybe we can put it on the first of every month,  we can have an updated schedule and we can have updated photos.  Maybe 10 or 15 and it can be just its own simple link and it says Burger Bob' s. That way you don' t need to have it on the Home Page,  you don' t need to have it on the Parks Page,  you don' t need to have it anywhere,  except for just on Burger Bob' s and it literally you' ll be updated like we do the first of every month.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  Commissioners,  the monthly update will be done very quickly,  as I mentioned,  the project manager is on vacation,  just got back today,  yesterday,  and then it will be updated very soon.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, can we have that, can we have that done?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Yes Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  And one more request.  Just have them test it in the search bar. You put in Burger Bob' s it can link right to it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Perfect.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You said that you were going to send us a link, right.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  I will.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  Can you take a moment and sit with Mr. Wells and show him how to go into that link. You said there' s already a schedule up.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Yes. It's under Parks Projects and Updates.  So, I will definitely let Mr. Wells know and I will send it to all of you in case you get any other questions.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you, Ms. Pantin.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There is a link on the city' s Home Page for current projects,  correct, general construction projects,  there was.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCommunications Director Pantin: For general construction projects, but those are Planning Projects,  these are not city projects.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  But I thought we had added city projects to that.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  I think they are from - I don' t want to speculate here,  because I'm not exactly sure.  I do believe that they are for sort of bigger projects,  general projects,  but we' ll definitely look into it and see what we can do.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: Okay.  If that already exists,  if we could add it to that as well,  I'll appreciate it.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you, Ms. Pantin.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.",

Thank you for being here with us.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Good morning,  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  Commissioners,  Mr. Manager,  Mr. Clerk and Ms. Attorney.  I'd like to speak to you today about the issue of streetlights.  I know I have spoken with most of you regarding this issue,  but I'd like to bring up a little something here just to share with you to continue that conversation.  I'll also be back to you later this morning for a resolution, an item by the Historic Preservation Board.  I've put together just a simple citizens presentation here for you, just to go through for a few minutes.  Regarding the streetlights -  streetlights as all of\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nus know are more than just lighting.  It's urban design.  It's decoration.  Its branding.  It' s what our community is. And so, Coral Gables began installing streetlights in the early 1920s as part of its master suburb and the streetlighting was always unique to Miami-Dade County.  Mr. Clerk.\n\n## City Clerk Urquia:  Yes sir.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Mr. Maxwell:  Thank you. There' s a 1923 photo of the Country Club all of us go to and enjoy and this is outside of Le Parc right now, and you can see that those are two streetlights that are not only representative of what we had,  but they were the majority lights throughout the community as Merrick developed it and into the 20s, and even after the city sold the lighting system to FPL in 1926.  You can see here in the commercial district,  there' s a representative streetlight.  All of the streetlights that were put in were called White Way Lights at that time. So,  streetlight was not a term that was generally used.  It was called a White Way Light. And it didn' t matter what kind of light it was. It was a White Way Light because we had white ways. Most of the streets were dark ways. Next please. Thank you. There' s an advertisement in the January 4, 1923, Miami Metropolis, and you can see in the picture there,  Dammers and Gillette,  are advertising the beautiful streets of this city. And what kind of streetlights do they show? - they show the standard city silver streetlight that we have today.  Next please.  At the time that the city was developed and really into the 30s, these were the three standard streetlights that the city seemed to have.  I'm sure that there were others mounted on a wood pole or something,  but this is what we can see mostly in pictures and in correspondence. You can see the Fink light, which surrounds the Douglas Entrance,  and those lights were used at some of the most important places in the city. They weren' t on Coral Way, they weren' t at DeSoto Fountain,  but they were at places like the Douglas Entrance.  You can see the standard metal and then you can also see what I call this transit line fixture. You know, we had a wonderful trolley that went through here, and those lights are attached to the electric lines that the trolley went to. The fountains and all of the monuments and entrances that we have all had the same type of what we call luminaire.  So, you can see that the fixtures in there all match what was there. Everything was silver. Everything had a look so that when you came into Coral Gables you knew that you were in a special place.  Thank you. You can see the transit light after the war over here on Miracle Mile, and then how that Fink light is there at the Douglas Entrance.  The history of the lights is really interesting.  In the 1980s,  right now I had the opportunity to go through the city archives and dig out a bunch of things,  because you know,  we' ve been working on this for ever and ever and ever,  and in 1980,  the city and the Historic Preservation Board identified 21 different types of streetlights in our city. I'm going to show you in just a few minutes almost a dozen.  The City Commission received a report and then discussed,  and I can' t find an action item where they actually adopted it but sought to standardize the streetlights in 1980 and begin working diligently with not only the Historic Preservation Board,  and the Board of Architects and other advisors,  but with the Florida Power and Light Company and Public Works Department.  After a while, about a year, it was an Arcadian fixture, which you can see right here, was selected and it's actually in the catalog of this company and it's called a Coral Gables Light Fixture, and this is the one that' s been in use really since that time. So, they provided this to FPL, told FPL and FPL came back and said the following,  company owned fixtures will normally be mounted on poles of the company' s existing distribution system and serve from overhead wires on request by the customer, of the customer,  the company will provide special poles and underground wires that charges specified below. In other words, this is their rate base.  We all know that FPL has a rate base.  They\n\nhave to go to the Public Service Commission.  They have to take everything that everybody asks them for and then have it approved,  and what we' re asking for is to come back and take a look at that. In 1986 FPL purchased these lights and installed them for us. We don' t have the capability to do it. They first went in on Segovia.  They are still there.  They look great,  haven' t been taken out. And so, this is what we have. The light I'm showing you right now though isn' t on Segovia,  but it' s exactly like the one there. This is over by the Douglas Entrance,  and it was just installed;  and if you look at the ground plan, you' ll see that there' s a new base and there' s the markings out for the new wire. So, they put this in and yet, they are taking out poles exactly like this and putting in black poles which are really not appropriate and haven' t been here.  If you would please.  Thank you.  Being a guy that' s been involved in cities for over 45 years,  I have to have a map,  and so I went around town and the red lines that you see on the map that' s where the silver standard White Way Lights are. Now they are intermixed with some of the Denman Fink lights and I'm thrilled to have those back. That' s just the best thing. I've been advocating that for years.  And Mayor and all of you here on the Commission,  I really applaud your efforts for this. It's so unique and I hope that we take advantage of that and continue to use those lights in even more special places,  but the whole idea here about this is to say look, we have a lot of these things already.  Let' s not change them,  let' s re-enforce it. Let' s also look at and see what we can do to, if you would please go to the next one, to change these streetlights,  because these are the most common streetlights that we have in Coral Gables.  The wood pole that you can see.  The one mounted on a concrete pole or the\u2026 concrete pole. Show the next one please. And then we have other streetlights.  And these other streetlights are generally with the exception of the one in the middle,  and that also happens there too,  are generally a private development,  but they are on city right-of-way.  Why doesn' t the city say hey, we' ve got a brand here, use our streetlights.  You get to put it in, you get to pay for it, but please use ours,  and you can use our great Denman Fink lights if you wish.  Go to the next one please.  We have the one in the middle is about four of them and they are over at the French Village on Hardee.  The one here,  let' s see,  on your right is all throughout the northeastern apartment district,  and they' ve been there since close to dirt, because I remember them there over 40 years ago.  And then the one over here that you see on the far left, that' s the Highway Department and that' s on 8th,  Calle Ocho.  And then if you go to Bird Road,  the Highway Department has another one entirely which we don' t have a picture.  I could go on and on and on. We' ve got lots of these things. But the really cool thing is, when you walk it, when you cross that line from wherever it is, from Dade County or the City of Miami or South Miami, and you come here to this special place, its street jewelry embraces you.  If you would go to the next,  please.  We have a new monument that we' ve put in. We' ve put in the black lights,  nobody really thought about that.  And then we have these other kind of street poles I really like. Those are the ones that should be fixed and there' s quite a few like those ones without hats or ones that are broken,  or they are severely tilted over.  So,  if you would please.  So really,  this is not just about history,  it' s about brand and urban design.  It' s about how we want our city to be and we' re going to talk about this a little bit further, and I highly recommend to the board and I will do it again when I read the resolution that we take a look at this and we do it in a deliberate way, that we take this opportunity to not only continue to brand and make our city great, but also to come up with standards that make it easy for us to not only identify where we are in the community.  No other city, no other area in South Florida has streetlights like we do,  nor the color that we have.  We are unique.  So,  with that I'd really recommend considering this and I look forward to speaking with you again about this issue shortly.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nThank you very much for your attention and thank you for anything.  If you have a question,  I'm happy to answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  I just wanted to say thank you for putting that together.  It took a lot of work. I know you take your time to really make sure you drove home the point of the importance of restoring and reviving our history.  I think we are going to go over it a few times. I think there are two items on the Commission that we' ll hear together that address this issue and I welcome you to come back again.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  I think you' ll notice also from the Commission;  I think we are all on the same page in regard to what we want to see.

You brought up something that I hadn' t thought about, I think is a great idea is the issue,  as developers continue to build throughout this community in one form or another or we invest in this community,  there should be uniformity on that front,  even if it' s something that' s existing,  we should like we' re doing with the White Way Lights.  We just got back ten,  I was there the other day when they brought them in, and we' re going to get about another eight that are in really good shape that are actually working.  So those again will be refurbished,  and they' ll be put somewhere prominently wherever the Historic Preservation and the Manager deem appropriate, and I think that' s something in the works that shows our commitment.

I worked with the Manager for years meeting with the President of FPL on multiple occasions,  to see how we can bridge the gap that we wouldn' t have to go to a referendum vote and have to spend close to, I think it was 275 million dollars to underground here in the city, and we found a way, a compromise and we got that project started last year, and its something that hopefully over the next 10 or 15 years we' ll significantly revamp our infrastructure here in the city.

I welcome any of my colleagues, whoever they' d like to name,  so that we can have someone dedicated to work on this issue with FPL to find a solution.  It may take six months,  it may take a year,  or it may be resolved in two weeks,  who knows.  But I think that once we have further conversations with FPL, I think we can find uniformity,  but I agree with you.  Future developments need to come online and find that uniform color that uniform look, so we have something a little bit more standard across the board.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  And if we go back to even replacing some of the lights that have been in, that' s not a problem,  because these lights are reusable, the wiring is reusable, everything. We' ve been through lots and lots of hurricanes on these things and the lights have all been there and they are still there. So, we are having an enjoyable time and our record shows that we' ve had a wonderful conversation as just as you said Mayor, with leadership by the Mayor,  by the Manager,  and by the Commission to do this and this was a multi-year process that previous Commissions, previous Managers,  and all went through to come up with what we' ve got,  and you know it takes a long time to evolve you know, and we' ve evolved into the best city in South Florida, if not the best city in Florida.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you for putting that together.  Mr. Manager.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  we have a complete presentation ready for the next Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And we' ve also asked FPL to join us at the next Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  What I would like to do when we have that presentation for the next Commission meeting,  I know Commissioner Fernandez put the item on the agenda,  I'd like for you to be here, obviously and anyone you' d like to bring that' s part of the board.  That' s one of the reasons why I sponsored the Landmark Advisory Board,  I pushed that forward,  to bridge that gap and to find an opportunity to make sure that we are addressing our landmarks and that they are not falling behind, because I'd rather,  I'd like to have the Landmark making noise, advisory board making noise that these landmarks are falling behind,  we need to address these issues,  and there' s a lot of people on that board that are very, very well versed on issues of historic preservation,  landmark,  we have a great team here. So, I'd like to have you here at the next meeting to make sure that you' re part of the conversation and it should be a conversation that' s had by everybody in this community.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  And it is a conversation,  Mr. Mayor. There' re no accusations of anything.  This is a positive direction for our community that will only make it better.\n\nMayor Lago:  This was started before,  this was started like in, when was the time that this was approved,  this rate.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  But before that, it was like 20 years ago,  wasn' t there a discussion on it, on the light poles? Maybe I'm confused.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  The new rate started about five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  the point is that we' ve got to figure out a solution and find something that' s appropriate and we' d love to have you and everybody else in regard to that conversation.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Mayor,  thank you. Its an honor. Its an honor to be with you and I thank you all for your consideration and your time. Thank you all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'm going to take the moment just for a short advertisement.  My Landmark Advisory Board appointee sent me an email indicating that she needs to step down, so if you know of anybody that is interested in serving,  I'd like to have a reappointment for the next Commission meeting,  so that slot is filled. It's an important board.  This Commission is insistent that we, this is an important issue,  we talked about it during our joint meeting with South Miami about branding, so I'm happy we' re moving forward on this.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think Marlin Ebbert is seeking to be appointed to a board. I think that' s something that might be right in her wheelhouse.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes, probably is. I just got the email yesterday,  so I've been reaching out to various members who are also interested in historic preservation, and Marlin I've known for years.  So, I know she would probably fit well.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Next speaker is Tom Wells.\n\nMayor Lago:  Sir, good morning.\n\nMr. Wells: Good morning.  My name is Tom Wells, I live at 1310 Coral Way in Coral Gables,  and my law firm offices is at 901 Ponce, which is in the American Airlines Building, also in the Gables. I spoke at the Commission meeting on December 12th and was told that the monthly construction schedule for John Bell Construction to complete the renovations of Burger Bob' s be published and accessible to the residents to monitor the progress.  Here' s the page of the construction projects currently on the website.  I'll give that to the City Clerk when I complete my discussion.  It was last updated in May 2023.  There is no reference for Burger Bob' s on that construction page.  In addition,  I can monitor the permit.  The current permit right now is 23-08-1877.   Unfortunately, that only tells me about the inspections.  It doesn' t tell me about the construction schedule.  On the John Bell construction contract,  Section 9.13 requires monthly updates.  And so, it would be good for the residents to understand the progress of Burger Bob' s renovation.  So, I'm just here to request what I requested at the last meeting.  Please post the construction schedule for the residents.  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you. Mr. Manager,  please give us an update in regard to the schedule.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias: Mr.  Mayor,  the scheduled completion is for July 29th of this year, substantial completion.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay. July 29th. City Manager Iglesias:  Of this year.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  And a quick question,  where are we right now? I haven' t driven by in a few weeks,  so I haven' t really seen it. How' s the progress coming along?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  The progress is coming fine. It just started and the progress is fine.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  Can you do me a favor and do the Commission a favor please.  Can we have the construction schedule up online by the next Commission meeting?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  I will check.  I thought it was up already.  We' ve been working on Fire House 4. Fire House 4, the contract was signed Friday.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And so now we're going to jump on this.  The project manager for this project has been out for two weeks on vacation,  so we will take care of that.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, if you may. Good morning.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Good morning,  Martha Pantin,  Communications. We did put the information up on the Parks page.  I will send you all a link and if you would like me to put it in any other location,  we' re happy to do so,  and we did include photos,  as requested by the Commission at the last Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, the schedule is up.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  The information we have is up. I will send you the link shortly to all of you,  so that you can see what we have up;  and obviously,  we are happy to make any changes that you would like, and if you would like us to put it in another location,  we can do that as well.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Can we put it on the Home Page?\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Pardon me.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Can we put it on the Home Page?\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  On the Home Page,  we can put it under News. We cannot put it as one of the five things, but we can put it definitely under the News section.\n\nMayor Lago:  Do we have a Burger Bob' s section right now?\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  No, we do not have.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm going to make it even easier.  What I would like to see is, for example,  we use a system in construction called Pro Core. We' re not going to put a Pro Core for access.  But what I would like to see is, there is going to be a link, drop box where people can go in there and see the schedule for the project,  construction,  and monthly update photos. Maybe we can put it on the first of every month,  we can have an updated schedule and we can have updated photos.  Maybe 10 or 15 and it can be just its own simple link and it says Burger Bob' s. That way you don' t need to have it on the Home Page,  you don' t need to have it on the Parks Page,  you don' t need to have it anywhere,  except for just on Burger Bob' s and it literally you' ll be updated like we do the first of every month.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  Commissioners,  the monthly update will be done very quickly,  as I mentioned,  the project manager is on vacation,  just got back today,  yesterday,  and then it will be updated very soon.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, can we have that, can we have that done?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Yes Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  And one more request.  Just have them test it in the search bar. You put in Burger Bob' s it can link right to it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Perfect.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You said that you were going to send us a link, right.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  I will.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  Can you take a moment and sit with Mr. Wells and show him how to go into that link. You said there' s already a schedule up.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Yes. It's under Parks Projects and Updates.  So, I will definitely let Mr. Wells know and I will send it to all of you in case you get any other questions.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you, Ms. Pantin.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There is a link on the city' s Home Page for current projects,  correct, general construction projects,  there was.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCommunications Director Pantin: For general construction projects, but those are Planning Projects,  these are not city projects.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  But I thought we had added city projects to that.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  I think they are from - I don' t want to speculate here,  because I'm not exactly sure.  I do believe that they are for sort of bigger projects,  general projects,  but we' ll definitely look into it and see what we can do.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: Okay.  If that already exists,  if we could add it to that as well,  I'll appreciate it.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you, Ms. Pantin.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.",
