-Goal-
Given a text document from the City of Coral Gables, identify all entities and their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.

**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**
1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.
2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., "Agenda Item E-1" and "Ordinance 2024-01") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.
    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).
    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `("relationship"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.
    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- title: Name of the entity, capitalized
- type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.
Format each entity as ("entity"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.
- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Examples-
Entity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION
Text: "Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed. This is Ordinance 2024-01."
Output:
("entity"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, which is the same as Ordinance 2024-01 and amends zoning.)
{record_delimiter}
("entity"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, also known as agenda item E-1, which amends zoning.)
{record_delimiter}
("relationship"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same as<|>10)
{completion_delimiter}
