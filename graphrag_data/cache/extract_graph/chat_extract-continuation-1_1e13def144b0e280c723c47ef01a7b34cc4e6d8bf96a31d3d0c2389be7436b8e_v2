And if you look at the plot lines of the lots, they' ve encroached on them. In other words,  one lot encroaches on another lot, and then they expand on that classroom.   And then when they bought the house across the street from us, I don' t know what you guys are using it for, I'd like to know because they do have a lot of activity going on in there,  and a lot of kids and parents coming in and out.  So, there are questions that were brought to my mind that weren' t there before because of this issue.   And if they are going to make an amendment to the covenant, I would like some things changed to that covenant going forward in order for this to be approved. Okay, baby, your turn.\n\nMr. Toyos:   I think that,  how do you call it, first of all, this thing about the --  what the Planning and Zoning Board,  it wasn' t us who asked for the swale improvement. It was the Planning and Zoning Board that said,  hey, you, you guys, this is on you.   It wasn' t us asking the Planning and Zoning Board.   We just went up there and,  how do you call it, said we have a traffic problem. They' re blocking our driveways.   Yeah,  I mean,  and this happens,  how do you call it, constantly. And I keep on hearing it's the Salvadore Park, people who come to Salvadore Park,  the dog park, the pickleballers.   I don' t see people with pickleball rackets coming down, you know, blocking our driveways or doing that.  We' re trying to just keep our swales like any normal one.  Yes, we have normal use of swale,  delivery guys,  postal service,  whatever. But at least with that,  we could maintain our grass.   We can' t maintain our grass.   Their side looks like a desert,  okay, on Cordova side.\n\nMs. Toyos:  ( INAUDIBLE)  the pictures?\n\nMr.  Toyos: One of our neighbors behind them has had his swale with,  how do you call it, landscaping now for, as long as I can remember.   You know, we' ve owned that property for over 20 years. They' ve had it for much more than that,  so they' ve dealt with it.   Our backdoor neighbors,  Mary and --  this is what it looks like.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is what the neighbors do to our sidewalks.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And this is what the other neighbors have to do to make sure that they don' t block them when the pickup and drop-off (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is barricades put up by, I guess,  the City.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:   The signs are being used to help the --  the signs alone are not enough.   This is what they' ve used to keep the people off the corner so that the intersection visibility doesn' t get blocked.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Toyos:   Sometimes I can' t get out of my house because people are blocking my entrance and exit.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Backdoor neighbor,  she had to put it because her driveway' s in the front, so Andalusia, corner of Andalusia,  and right behind us,  and -on Cordova,  they had to put landscape in their front.  Now their side is still barren.   They can' t do anything.   It's --  I mean,  we can' t maintain our grass.   And it's not the people using the dog park.   It's not the people using the pickleball courts or tennis courts.  It's parents.   And we reached out to the pastor,  with all due respect,  in 2022.  We went in and we sat with her.  Nothing' s come from it.  Nothing.   The Planning and Zoning asked them,  hey, reach out to the neighbor.   Just try to take care of their situation.\n\nMs. Toyos:   They didn' t reach out.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Nothing.   We' ve tried to be neighborly. And to say that we' re not --  asking is not neighborly,  no, it was the Planning and Zoning Board.   All of them agreed that, hey, this is on you guys.   This is not on them.   So, we just want a solution,  but we also want to know --  there' s two issues here.   They bought that house in 2016 and now has an exemption.   So, they' re paying $ 67. So, I imagine that they' re having a school and it says an educational exemption on that property in the corner right across from us.  And by the way, we' re only 130 feet.  We might not be adjacent, but our radius,  we' re 130 feet from their closest property line, their campus property line.  So,  if they' re there and they' re claiming that exemption,  what' s the use of this property?   Because this is what' s causing the issues. If they' re going to keep on buying single- family homes and converting them over into school space,  it defeats the purpose.   They have no parking\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where community and city issues were discussed including neighborhood concerns and zoning matters.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City Planning and Zoning Board responsible for zoning decisions and enforcement, referenced as the body that requested swale improvements and neighbor outreach.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALVADORE PARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Local park referenced as a location where people gather, including dog park users and pickleball players.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PICKLEBALLERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Group of people playing pickleball at Salvadore Park, mentioned in context of driveway blocking concerns.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
