Key entities include the SITE_PLAN, SITE_PLAN_BOUNDARIES, BUILDING_FOOTPRINT, CAMPUS_FOOTPRINT, PROPERTY_ACQUISITION, and PROPERTY_FOR_GUESTS. The SITE_PLAN establishes the fixed boundaries and building footprints, which remain unchanged unless formally amended. PROPERTY_ACQUISITION activities occur independently and do not affect the site plan boundaries or campus footprint.

This plan is critical as it sets the framework within which all campus development and property use must operate. Any changes to the site plan boundaries or building footprints require formal amendments, underscoring the plan's role in maintaining regulatory compliance and campus integrity. This foundational role is supported by the high degree of connectivity the SITE_PLAN has with other entities such as PROPERTY_ACQUISITION and BUILDING_FOOTPRINT [Data: Entities (1026); Relationships (1527, 1529)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"PROPERTY_ACQUISITION does not affect site plan boundaries\",\n      \"explanation\": \"PROPERTY_ACQUISITION refers to the acquisition of property by the school or related entities that does not alter the approved site plan boundaries.
