The restrictive covenants impose legal restrictions on property use, including mandatory public hearings and approvals before any demolition or building changes. The public hearing process is a formal procedure required to ensure transparency and community involvement in decisions related to property alterations.

These covenants explicitly require that any demolition or building changes undergo a public hearing and receive approval before proceeding. This legal framework ensures that property owners and developers comply with established restrictions, thereby maintaining orderly development and protecting community interests.

It mandates that any proposed modifications to properties, including site plan changes and demolitions, must be presented and discussed in a public forum. This process promotes transparency and allows stakeholders, including community members and regulatory bodies, to participate in decision-making.

It formalizes the necessity of public hearings as a prerequisite for property modifications, reinforcing the importance of community oversight and regulatory compliance.
