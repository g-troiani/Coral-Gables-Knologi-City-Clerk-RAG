So, in summary,  the preemption is for the use,  the density,  and the height.  The use is for mixed- use districts.  I just went through the map of where those districts are in our urban areas, analyzed citywide and the height is whatever is allowed within one mile of that proposed property.  So,  the legislation before you today is what the Live Local Act is requiring the city to consider and that is a parking reduction within a half-a-mile of the development and the city can define what major transit stop means.  So, the legislation before you is to find major transit stop as a metro station or the intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with frequencies of service intervals of 15 minutes or less,  during morning and afternoon peak commute periods. So, taking a look at the better bus network, there have been some improvements to our bus system,  and so this would apply to Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas,  and Coral Way. Those will meet the kind of high frequency bus routes.  This is the map showing half-a-mile\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nfrom those intersecting points and also including the Metrorail stops. You can see it's mostly along our urban areas and then close to the City of South Miami.  So,  the criteria to request a parking reduction from the Commission would be half-a-mile from the major transit stop. It would have to be an accessible route from one quarter mile of that property of the development and a major transit stop. The Commission would consider any impact that parking reductions may have on a neighborhood and making sure its compatible with the surrounding area and the parking reductions are based on the size of the property.  So, a greater,  larger property would have less reduction and a larger reduction would be for the smaller properties and that would be to discourage larger,  taller buildings that may be out of character with the surrounding area.  And the Commission can also grant any rate of parking reductions that' s less than 6,000 square feet.  And that' s all I have.  So, staff is here, legal is here to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have one question on accessible route.  Let' s say that accessibility is defined as ADA compliant accessibility.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, I think we have, and I can bring it right now that the ordinance had,  sidewalks,  ramps,  crosswalks,  any way that' s easily to get to need proposed development to the major transit stop.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Okay.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I only have a question I brought up at agenda review.  You mentioned trolley stops and bus stops as triggering the need for this legislation or compatibility and I think in the discussion recently the county took away one of our, several bus stops or bus routes that we normally have.  So,  we' ll be passing legislation connected to particular bus stops when bus stops now, we know come and go, but once we approve this reduction in parking, even if those bus stops disappear down the road,  we still have the impact of today' s legislation.  I know we' re bound or required to do it, but its sort of not well thought out in Tallahassee,  but maybe that' s the norm these days.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  That' s the consideration the Commission makes if there' s a proposed development that once a reduction of parking maybe there' s a line that you think is not used that often,  maybe the concern that the county may remove it in the future, that' s up to your discretion.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  Right.  In each instance it will come to you all to consider and approve if that' s the will of the Commission to the parking reduction based on a consideration of the impact of the development on parking and the character of each particular neighborhood.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  And I just want to clarify that the ordinance doesn' t tie a consideration to a specific bus stop,  but it just defines a criteria to determine what a mass transit stop is, and so, if a bus stop is eliminated,  for example,  it wouldn' t require an amendment to the ordinance or to the zoning code, that criteria remain static.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that feedback.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you for the presentation.  You gave a good explanation of what we' re facing with Live Local. Any comments from the public.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Yes sir. We have a member of the public on Zoom who would like to speak is Aky Fernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:  The floor is yours. Good afternoon.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes sir.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Okay. Good afternoon,  everyone,  Aky Fernandez,  1542 Mendavia.  I'm a resident of the city lifelong.  Also, an architect and a builder.  Happy with this proposed legislation.  I think it' s a step in the right direction.  The only thing that I will say after sort of reading through it, you know frankly,  the reductions that are being proposed while I think they are well-intentioned,  I actually don' t think it' s going to go a significant way in terms of making the final product more affordable.  To be frank,  they need to be more generous,  the parking reductions,  if we' re actually going to see some of this inventory get built. I'll give you an example.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DRC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Design Review Committee involved in reviewing development proposals before permitting)\n##(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF ARCHITECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Board responsible for architectural oversight and review in the city)\n##(\"entity\"<|>LIVE LOCAL ACT<|>PROJECT<|>Legislation requiring the city to consider parking reductions within a half-mile of certain developments near major transit stops)\n##(\"entity\"<|>MAJOR TRANSIT STOP<|>PROJECT<|>Defined as a metro station or intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with service intervals of 15 minutes or less during peak commute periods)\n##(\"entity\"<|>FLAGLER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bus route included in the better bus network improvements)\n##(\"entity\"<|>8TH STREET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bus route included in the better bus network improvements)\n##(\"entity\"<|>DOUGLAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bus route included in the better bus network improvements)\n##(\"entity\"<|>CORAL WAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bus route included in the better bus network improvements)\n##(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF SOUTH MIAMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Neighboring city near the urban areas discussed in the legislation)\n##(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting where the Live Local Act and related parking reduction legislation were discussed)\n##(\"entity\"<|>ADA COMPLIANT ACCESSIBILITY<|>PROJECT<|>Accessibility standard referenced in relation to accessible routes to major transit stops)\n##(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>General reference to the ordinance discussed by Planning Official Garcia concerning sidewalks, ramps, and crosswalks for accessibility)\n##(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor who asked questions about accessible routes and ADA compliance)\n##(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING OFFICIAL GARCIA<|>PERSON<|>City planning official providing clarifications about the ordinance and criteria for major transit stops)\n##(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>City Commissioner raising concerns about bus stop changes and legislation impact)\n##(\"entity\"<|>CITY ATTORNEY SUAREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney explaining the Commission's discretion on parking reductions)\n##(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor presiding over the City Commission meeting and inviting public comments)\n##(\"entity\"<|>CITY CLERK URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk facilitating public participation in the meeting)\n##(\"entity\"<|>AKY FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Resident, architect, and builder speaking in support of the proposed legislation)\n##(\"entity\"<|>1542 MENDAVIA<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Address of Aky Fernandez, identifying his residence)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>ORDINANCE<|>LIVE LOCAL ACT<|>The ordinance discussed implements the requirements of the Live Local Act concerning parking reductions<|>8)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>LIVE LOCAL ACT<|>The Live Local Act legislation was the subject of discussion at the City Commission Meeting<|>9)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>PLANNING OFFICIAL GARCIA<|>ORDINANCE<|>Planning Official Garcia explained details of the ordinance related to accessibility and transit stops<|>9)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>ORDINANCE<|>Vice Mayor Anderson asked questions about the ordinance's accessibility provisions<|>7)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>ORDINANCE<|>Commissioner Menendez raised concerns about the ordinance's impact given changes in bus stops<|>7)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>CITY ATTORNEY SUAREZ<|>ORDINANCE<|>City Attorney Suarez discussed the Commission's discretion in applying the ordinance<|>7)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>Mayor Lago presided over the City Commission Meeting<|>9)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>CITY CLERK URQUIA<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>City Clerk Urquia facilitated public participation during the meeting<|>9)\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AKY FERNANDEZ<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>Aky Fernandez spoke as a member of the public during the City Commission Meeting<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
