This enforcement action includes initiating the conversion at the property owner's expense, recording liens on the property, certifying expenses to the finance director, and enforcing payment through special assessment liens with interest and penalties. This centralized control ensures that the city maintains updated and compliant utility infrastructure, reflecting a strong regulatory framework.

The \\\"NOTICE OF PROPERTY OWNER'S FAILURE TO CONVERT FACILITIES\\\" is a critical document issued by the City Manager to property owners who have not completed the required underground conversion. This notice demands completion within 60 days and warns of city-initiated conversion and lien imposition if ignored.

Registered mail is the primary method used to send notices regarding conversion completion or failure, deemed sufficient when properly addressed and mailed. However, if registered mail is returned or personal service is not possible, law enforcement officers step in to serve notices either by personal delivery or by physically posting them on the property. This multi-tiered approach ensures that property owners receive proper notification, fulfilling legal requirements and minimizing disputes over notice delivery.
