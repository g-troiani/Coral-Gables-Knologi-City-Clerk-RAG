Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The actual ceremony.  Not asking the question with however we word the survey questions,  actually having it, then being in it, and then deciding,  yes,  I like this more or no, I don' t like this more.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  That' s a pilot.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm not in favor of that.  I think it would be great to just do what Commissioner Menendez said and we move on.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I like the option that Commissioner Menendez suggested. Let' s try to organize our schedule better.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'm fine with starting earlier,  but I know there are folks that drop off their kids and that time is precious to a lot of people,  and we' re already here and staff included.  I would like the pilot to be morning and then like 12:30, see how it goes.  If we get through it fast, great,  if not, then I'm going to support a different option,  but I look to you and the administration to identify how you group them. If it was me, I would group morning certain types and afternoons time certain,  a certain time, and see if we move things forward.  I'm just - if it doesn' t work, then I'm going back to my original.\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  We can certainly look into that. I like the idea of maybe employees in the morning,  most of our employees do start at 8 in the morning.  So, we can have the employees easily here at 8 or at 8:30 in the morning,  and then maybe our standard protocols in the afternoon. We can certainly try something and if an employee works in the afternoon,  then maybe we can move that employee for the 12 o' clock slot.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago: I'm happy you mentioned that, because I was going to mention that to Commissioner Fernandez.  Our city starts at 8 o' clock in the morning,  we can start at 9 o' clock.  So, at the end of the day, the employees are here. So, to me, if we have it at 8 o' clock it's even better, because they get to work even faster.  That was one of the issues that we had when Mayor Valdes-Fauli was doing it.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I want to sweeten the pot.  Just because.  We' ve had that conversation before on another topic, maybe we can have 12:30 protocol and take a break for lunch.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s how I sweeten the pot.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There used to be a time certain 12:30 for lunch. What happened to that?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Well, that' s what I'm trying to bring back.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach hasn' t forgotten about it.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I know, but that was approved,  and it just was done away with.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  If it's okay, it's not my item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That really sweetens the pot - 12:30 time certain.  My stomach approves.\n\nLaughter]\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I agree with that one.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I think I'm hypo-glycemic right now.\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we do this. Why don' t we, at the next Commission meeting,  put together something that deals with the morning and an afternoon session,  and we' ll see how that goes with the approval of the Commission through the Manager and we find a solution for that.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  So,  I guess what you' re suggesting is, at 9 a.m. we start with presentation and protocol.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  9:30 we do time certain public comment.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we go earlier. Why don' t we do 8:30? Why not?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Because there are members of staff are coming not from here, there are members of staff who live in Kendall,  who live in Homestead.  You' re affectingâ€¦\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on. Hold on. Mr. Manager,  when are employees supposed to be here at work?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  At 8 o' clock.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s their job.  So,  if they are coming from Kendall or from anywhere,  they are coming,  at the end of the day, they have got to be here by 8.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I will withdraw my idea. Look, simple.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach objects.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: I know.  Sorry.  Trial run 9 a.m.  obviously we do the Pledge of Allegiance,  maybe we' re done by 9:30, 9:40, we go to Public Comments,  Time Certain 12:30, and if we' re having a good day, we have lunch right after maybe 15 minutes and we come back to wrap up. At least we have structure and I think if we' re all supportive of that structure,  it will help us make it happen.  So that' s just me. If it doesn' t work, we' ll come up with another.\n\nMayor Lago:  Is that a motion? Want to second that?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, who emphasized the importance of actually having the ceremony and participating in it before deciding preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, who referred to the proposal as a pilot and discussed scheduling preferences including starting earlier and grouping sessions by morning and afternoon.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, who expressed opposition to the pilot idea, supported Commissioner Menendez's suggestion, and discussed city employee start times and meeting scheduling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, who supported Commissioner Menendez's scheduling suggestion and humorously referenced the \"12:30 time certain\" lunch protocol.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, who proposed organizing the meeting schedule better, suggested a 12:30 time certain lunch break, and outlined a trial run schedule starting at 9 a.m. with structured sessions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELEJABARRIETA<|>PERSON<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta, who discussed employee start times and the possibility of scheduling employees in the morning and afternoon slots accordingly.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting, during which the Commissioners and Mayor discussed scheduling options, pilot proposals, employee start times, and meeting protocols including public comments and lunch breaks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Iglesias, who stated that employees are supposed to be at work by 8 o'clock.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CASTRO<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>Commissioner Castro participated in the City Commission Meeting discussing the ceremony and survey questions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>Commissioner Fernandez contributed to the discussion about pilot scheduling, starting times, and public comment sessions during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>Mayor Lago led and contributed to the discussion on meeting scheduling, employee start times, and protocols during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDERSON<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>Vice Mayor Anderson participated in the City Commission Meeting, supporting scheduling suggestions and commenting on lunch protocols.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>Commissioner Menendez proposed scheduling changes and a trial run during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELEJABARRIETA<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta provided input on employee start times and scheduling during the City Commission Meeting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_IGLESIAS<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>City Manager Iglesias provided information about employee work start times during the City Commission Meeting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>FERNANDEZ<|>Mayor Lago responded directly to Commissioner Fernandez's concerns about employee start times and meeting scheduling.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>ANDERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez's suggestion of a 12:30 time certain lunch break was supported humorously by Vice Mayor Anderson.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>FERNANDEZ<|>Commissioner Menendez and Commissioner Fernandez discussed the 12:30 time certain lunch protocol and its previous approval.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>MENENDEZ<|>Mayor Lago supported Commissioner Menendez's suggestion to organize the meeting schedule better.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
