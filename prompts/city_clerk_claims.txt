Extract voting records, motions, and decisions from city clerk documents.

Examples of entities to extract:
- Agenda Items: E-1, F-10, H-3 (format: letter-number)
- Document Numbers: 2024-01, 2024-15 (format: year-number)
- When you see "Item E-1" or "Agenda Item E-1", extract "E-1" as entity type "agenda_item"

Focus on:
1. Voting outcomes (passed, failed, unanimous)
2. Motion details and sponsors
3. Agenda item references and their outcomes
4. Document numbers and their relationships
5. Meeting decisions and their context
