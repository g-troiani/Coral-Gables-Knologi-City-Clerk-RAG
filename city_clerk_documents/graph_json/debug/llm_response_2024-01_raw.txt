Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided document. The instructions say to look through the entire document. Let me start by reading through each part carefully.

Starting with Page 1, the document is an ordinance from Coral Gables, numbered 2024-01. The title and various WHEREAS clauses are there, but I don't see any agenda item mentioned here. The main sections (SECTION 1, 2, etc.) don't have it either. 

Moving to Page 2, after the sections, there's a part about the ordinance being passed on January 9, 2024. There's a line with "Moved: Fernandez / Seconded: Anderson" followed by the yeas and the vote being unanimous. Then, right before the signatures, I notice "AgendaItem: E-1)". That looks like the code they're asking for. The format here is "AgendaItem: E-1" with a closing parenthesis, but the code itself is E-1. The examples given in the query show that even if there's a period or other punctuation, we just take the code as it appears. So the correct code here is E-1. I should make sure there's no other instance elsewhere. Scanning again, I don't see any other mentions. The answer should be E-1.
