Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

So, I'd like to have you here at the next meeting to make sure that you' re part of the conversation and it should be a conversation that' s had by everybody in this community.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  And it is a conversation,  Mr. Mayor. There' re no accusations of anything.  This is a positive direction for our community that will only make it better.\n\nMayor Lago:  This was started before,  this was started like in, when was the time that this was approved,  this rate.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  But before that, it was like 20 years ago,  wasn' t there a discussion on it, on the light poles? Maybe I'm confused.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  The new rate started about five or six years ago.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  the point is that we' ve got to figure out a solution and find something that' s appropriate and we' d love to have you and everybody else in regard to that conversation.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Mayor,  thank you. Its an honor. Its an honor to be with you and I thank you all for your consideration and your time. Thank you all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'm going to take the moment just for a short advertisement.  My Landmark Advisory Board appointee sent me an email indicating that she needs to step down, so if you know of anybody that is interested in serving,  I'd like to have a reappointment for the next Commission meeting,  so that slot is filled. It's an important board.  This Commission is insistent that we, this is an important issue,  we talked about it during our joint meeting with South Miami about branding, so I'm happy we' re moving forward on this.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think Marlin Ebbert is seeking to be appointed to a board. I think that' s something that might be right in her wheelhouse.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes, probably is. I just got the email yesterday,  so I've been reaching out to various members who are also interested in historic preservation, and Marlin I've known for years.  So, I know she would probably fit well.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Next speaker is Tom Wells.\n\nMayor Lago:  Sir, good morning.\n\nMr. Wells: Good morning.  My name is Tom Wells, I live at 1310 Coral Way in Coral Gables,  and my law firm offices is at 901 Ponce, which is in the American Airlines Building, also in the Gables. I spoke at the Commission meeting on December 12th and was told that the monthly construction schedule for John Bell Construction to complete the renovations of Burger Bob' s be published and accessible to the residents to monitor the progress.  Here' s the page of the construction projects currently on the website.  I'll give that to the City Clerk when I complete my discussion.  It was last updated in May 2023.  There is no reference for Burger Bob' s on that construction page.  In addition,  I can monitor the permit.  The current permit right now is 23-08-1877.   Unfortunately, that only tells me about the inspections.  It doesn' t tell me about the construction schedule.  On the John Bell construction contract,  Section 9.13 requires monthly updates.  And so, it would be good for the residents to understand the progress of Burger Bob' s renovation.  So, I'm just here to request what I requested at the last meeting.  Please post the construction schedule for the residents.  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you. Mr. Manager,  please give us an update in regard to the schedule.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias: Mr.  Mayor,  the scheduled completion is for July 29th of this year, substantial completion.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay. July 29th. City Manager Iglesias:  Of this year.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  And a quick question,  where are we right now? I haven' t driven by in a few weeks,  so I haven' t really seen it. How' s the progress coming along?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  The progress is coming fine. It just started and the progress is fine.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  Can you do me a favor and do the Commission a favor please.  Can we have the construction schedule up online by the next Commission meeting?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  I will check.  I thought it was up already.  We' ve been working on Fire House 4. Fire House 4, the contract was signed Friday.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And so now we're going to jump on this.  The project manager for this project has been out for two weeks on vacation,  so we will take care of that.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, if you may. Good morning.\n\nCommunications Director Pantin:  Good morning,  Martha Pantin,  Communications. We did put the information up on the Parks page.  I will send you all a link and if you would like me\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LANDMARK ADVISORY BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Landmark Advisory Board is a board focused on historic preservation issues in Coral Gables, consisting of many well-versed members.
