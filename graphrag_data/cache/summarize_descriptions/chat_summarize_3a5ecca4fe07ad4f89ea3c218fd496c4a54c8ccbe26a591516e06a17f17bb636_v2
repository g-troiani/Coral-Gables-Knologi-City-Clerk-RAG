This chapter establishes the legal framework for how and when public notices must be disseminated to ensure transparency and public awareness of government actions. Notably, the statutes have been amended by House Bill 7049 (HB 7049), which introduced provisions allowing the publication of legal notices on publicly accessible websites. This amendment modernized the legal notice requirements by permitting digital publication as an alternative to traditional print methods, thereby increasing accessibility and potentially reducing costs associated with legal notices. Overall, Florida Statutes Chapter 50 provides comprehensive regulations on legal notice requirements, balancing the need for public notification with evolving methods of communication.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762930, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
