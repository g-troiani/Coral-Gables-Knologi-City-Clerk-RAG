It is the designated area used to determine the local median adjusted income (AMI), which is essential for setting affordable housing rent limits. This role underscores the county’s importance in housing policy and affordability measures. Additionally, Miami-Dade County is responsible for establishing a county-wide website for legal notices, as mandated by Florida Statutes. This centralized platform will be utilized by municipalities such as the City of Coral Gables to publish their legal notices, enhancing transparency and accessibility of public information. Furthermore, Miami-Dade County’s regulatory framework includes Code Section 33-193.7, which is referenced in local government agenda items concerning the applicability and minimum standards for siting city facilities, including workforce housing.
