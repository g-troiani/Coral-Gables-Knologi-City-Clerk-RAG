The timing for the publication of the notice varies slightly but generally must occur at least ten to fifteen days before the Public Hearing. The notice includes essential details about the hearing, such as the date, time, location, and subject matter to be discussed. In addition to the newspaper publication, the notice may be supplemented by courtesy notices and postings on relevant properties to further inform interested parties.
