Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: search the entire document, extract only the code in the specified format, and nothing else. 

First, I'll start by skimming through the document text provided. The document is Resolution No. 2024-05 from the City of Coral Gables. The main body talks about a pilot program for setting time-certain agenda items for presentations and protocol items. But the key here is to look for any mention of an agenda item code.

Looking at the first page, the title and sections mention "presentation and protocol items" but no code yet. The WHEREAS clauses discuss the reasons for the resolution but again, no code. Sections 1 through 4 outline the resolution's provisions but still no code in the format like E-2 or F-10.

Now, moving to the second page. The end of the document has some administrative details. The last few lines include "AgendaItem: F-10)" right before the signatures and other information. That looks like the code they're asking for. 

Wait, the user specified to check the entire document. Let me double-check. The phrase "AgendaItem: F-10)" is there. The format matches the examples given (like F-10). The hyphen might be a dash here, but in the example, it's written as F-10. The document uses a hyphen between F and 10. So "F-10" is the code. 

I need to make sure there's no other code mentioned elsewhere. Scanning again, the rest of the document doesn't have any other references. The only place where "AgendaItem" is mentioned with a code is that line. 

Therefore, the correct code is F-10. The user wants only the code in the exact format, so the answer should be AGENDA_ITEM: F-10.


AGENDA_ITEM: F-10
