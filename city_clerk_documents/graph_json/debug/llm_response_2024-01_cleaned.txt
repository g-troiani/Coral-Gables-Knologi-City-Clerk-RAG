Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided document. The instructions say to look everywhere in the document. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

Looking at the first page, there's a lot of "WHEREAS" clauses and sections, but I don't see any mention of an agenda item there. The first page ends with some DocuSign info, but nothing yet. 

Moving to the second page, after the "NOW, THEREFORE, BEITORDAINED..." sections, there are the sections 1 through 5. Then after section 5, it mentions the date, the movers and seconder, the yeas, and the vote. Then I see "AgendaItem: E-1)" right here. Wait, that's in the line after the vote. The exact text is "AgendaItem: E-1)". 

I need to check if that's the correct format. The examples given include things like "Agenda Item: E-2" or "Item E-2". Here it's written as "AgendaItem: E-1)" with a closing parenthesis. The user said to include exactly as found, so the code would be E-1. 

I should make sure there's no other instance. Scanning the rest of the document, the next lines have APPROVED by the Mayor, then the clerk and attorney's names. No other codes there. 

So the only occurrence is "AgendaItem: E-1)". The code is E-1. The user wants it exactly as presented, so even though there's a parenthesis at the end, the code itself is E-1. The examples show that even if there's a period or other characters, we just take the code part. So the answer should be E-1.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-1
