Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

And I've done it where we don' t even -we don' t announce that we' re going because I want to see it when it's…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Right.\n\nMayor Lago:   Really happening not where…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Let' s do it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Not when parents have been notified.  But I think that what we need to do is -- what we need to do is we need to have a conversation between first and second reading,  maybe the City Attorney can also join the conversation to find a solution to address what the Planning and Zoning Board and what your requests are.  There has to be common ground.   Ms. Russo?\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Mr. Mayor, we did that by the way.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know, I know, but let me hear from Ms. Russo.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We' ve reached out several times.\n\nMayor Lago:   And I want my colleagues to give me input and give me advice on what they would like to see.\n\nMs. Russo:   So, I'd like to rebut a couple of the statements.   So, with use of the swale,  I'm going to submit some photos that were taken not only of the neighbor' s home,  but of the church house across the street.   And Reverend Conroy will come address the use of that property.   And there are people parked on the swale of the church property that are cars that visit the home across the street. So, the use of the swale is being used as, you know, a public right-of-way for parking.   So, I just want to submit these pictures because it' s not just happening on their side of the street. It' s happening on the church property and people that use his home.   And some of these are taken at six in the morning,  so they' re not taken,  you know, when drop-off.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   You can put…\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSuÆrez:  Just make sure the Clerk has them,  please.\n\nMayor Lago:   Give them to the Clerk.\n\nMs. Russo:   And so I can let you know that I've been representing the school since 2000, I believe it was 2000 when I was first hired in 2001 through 3 when we did the master site plan.  And I can tell you that the that the master site plan did involve a new building.   The church,  as you know, owns a home in which Reverend Conroy lives.  They also own a home on Coral Way.  They have visiting clergy,  and all of this was addressed in the Declaration of Restrictive Covenants.   We are here precisely because one of the conditions from the restrictive covenants was that if any building were to be demolished,  that it would have to go through the public hearing process and be approved\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nand go --  and you know,  be approved by the Board of Architects and be approved. Because a church owns a property doesn' t make it part of the school.  But for that, I'm going to ask Reverend Conroy to just slip in the rebuttal the response to that.\n\nMs. Conroy:   Still Mary Beth Conroy,  still confused about swales.   The St. Philip' s has bought a series of homes throughout the years,  long before my arrival in 2016.   The home at 1100 Coral Way became available and we purchased it for a residence for our head of school.   We rented it for two years before the head of school moved in.  We had a head of school who lived there for two years.   And then since that time, we have housed clergy there.  It is not used for classroom.   It is not used for children.   It is not authorized for use for children.   And we have no intention of growing the number of children at our school.   What we want is better space,  but that house has never,  ever been used as a meeting place for children or teaching or anything.   We have a visiting bishop who comes for a month or two at a time.  We have --  that' s really all we' ve used it for is a residence.   So, it sits there empty a good part of the time, and occasionally,  we have someone stay there.   That' s it.   It' s a residence.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Do you have anything else, Ms. Russo?\n\nMs. Russo:   Excuse me?\n\nMayor Lago:   Do you have anything else you' d like to say?\n\nMs.  Russo: Yes,  I would just like to say that,  once again,  I think this is a community, a neighborhood issue.   It' s not an issue that should lay solely on the shoulders of St. Philip' s.   I'm aware of the swale package.   In fact, one of the neighbors --  we did have a neighborhood meeting, which the Toyos did not attend,  but the neighbor,  Dr. Forachi ( phonetic)  and the Lopez Cotardi phonetic),  we talked about the ability to landscape your swale since there has been so much use of a public swale.   I happen to live on Country Club Prado,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, involving discussions among Mayor Lago, Mr. Tuyos, Ms. Russo, Reverend Conroy, City Attorney Suárez, and others regarding neighborhood and property issues including swale use and restrictive covenants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding official at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, facilitating discussion on neighborhood issues and legislative process between first and second reading.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
