Composed of Mayor Vince Lago, Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson, Commissioner Melissa Castro, Commissioner Ariel Fernandez, and Commissioner Kirk Menendez, the Commission conducts regular meetings to address various city matters, including zoning, community issues, public hearings, and legislative approvals. For instance, during the meeting held on January 9, 2024, the Commission discussed topics such as Salvadore Park, school agreements, signage regulations, and passed several resolutions and ordinances unanimously, including Resolution Nos. 2024-01 and 2024-04, Ordinance No. 3576, and Ordinance No. 2024-02.\n\nThe City Commission holds the authority to hear objections to assessment resolutions, receive advice from the City Manager, and consider recommendations from advisory bodies such as the Planning and Zoning Board and the Development Review Committee. It is responsible for reviewing and deciding on zoning matters, including the approval or denial of Zoning in Progress Resolutions, moratoriums, and amendments to site plans, such as the major amendment to the St. Philip’s School site plan. The Commission also considers zoning code regulations related to floor area ratio (FAR), open space, parking, height, density, and preempted uses under the Live Local Act.\n\nIn addition to zoning and planning, the City Commission oversees environmental and infrastructure-related approvals. It conducts public hearings and approves or disapproves applications for dredging, filling, construction of bulkheads, seawalls, docks, and mooring piles, often requiring biological and ecological studies and coordination with agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and trustees of the internal improvement fund. The Commission also manages city-owned property sales or leases and sets policies related to these assets.\n\nThe Commission is responsible for adopting resolutions and ordinances concerning the city’s sewage disposal system, including fixing and revising rates, fees, and charges, compelling treatment of sewage by industrial plants, and authorizing sewer revenue bonds. It also appoints members to various advisory boards, such as the Senior Citizens Advisory Board, and manages election-related duties, including appointing substitute and alternate members to the canvassing board, delegating appointment authority in emergencies, and adopting resolutions to accept certified election results following run-off elections.\n\nFurthermore, the City Commission has the authority to establish or modify city facilities by resolution, direct operations without regard to zoning restrictions, and conduct public hearings related to the construction, modification, or operation of these facilities. It also receives recommendations from the City Attorney on matters such as government settlements.\n\nOverall, the City Commission of Coral Gables serves as the central legislative and decision-making body, ensuring the city’s governance, regulatory compliance, community welfare, and infrastructure development through comprehensive oversight, public engagement, and collaborative advisory input.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762921, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 580, "prompt_tokens": 1099, "total_tokens": 1679, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
