Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nEntity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION\nText: \"Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed.

Why not?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Because there are members of staff are coming not from here, there are members of staff who live in Kendall,  who live in Homestead.  You' re affecting…\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on. Hold on. Mr. Manager,  when are employees supposed to be here at work?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  At 8 o' clock.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s their job.  So,  if they are coming from Kendall or from anywhere,  they are coming,  at the end of the day, they have got to be here by 8.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I will withdraw my idea. Look, simple.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach objects.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: I know.  Sorry.  Trial run 9 a.m.  obviously we do the Pledge of Allegiance,  maybe we' re done by 9:30, 9:40, we go to Public Comments,  Time Certain 12:30, and if we' re having a good day, we have lunch right after maybe 15 minutes and we come back to wrap up. At least we have structure and I think if we' re all supportive of that structure,  it will help us make it happen.  So that' s just me. If it doesn' t work, we' ll come up with another.\n\nMayor Lago:  Is that a motion? Want to second that?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Wait. What time is the…\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on a second.  Hold on. Hold on.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, because I have a question.\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I just have a question about,  what time is the second presentation protocol?\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And then lunch right after that.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Right after.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  I'll second.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, question.  Is this direction to start this next meeting or is this…?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes. Yes.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  All in favor.\n\nAll: Aye.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Anyone opposed?\n\nMayor Lago:  By the way, employees will still be here at 8 o' clock though,  so we could start at 8. Moving on.
