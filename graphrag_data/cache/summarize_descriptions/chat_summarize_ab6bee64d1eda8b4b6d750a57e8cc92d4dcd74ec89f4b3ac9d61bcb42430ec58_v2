Currently, signs within the MX2 District are limited to a maximum size of 250 square inches. However, there is a proposed ordinance aiming to reduce this maximum allowable sign size significantly to 40 square inches. The district is subject to a height limitation of 70 feet, ensuring that buildings within this zone do not exceed this vertical restriction. On GIS maps, the MX2 District is typically represented in a bluish-gray color. This district is among the mixed-use zoning areas impacted by the Live Local Act, which influences zoning regulations and development standards within the community.
