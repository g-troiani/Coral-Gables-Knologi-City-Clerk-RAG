It is a key community organization actively involved in business and real estate matters, particularly those related to signage and ordinance improvements. The Chamber has been deeply engaged in the wrap ordinance process, with strong recommendations from city leadership, including Mayor Lago, to provide input on related regulatory matters.\n\nRepresented by Thad Adams, the immediate vice chair, and Sarah Hernandez, who speaks on behalf of the business community, the Chamber has participated in important discussions at the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024. During this meeting, the Chamber addressed concerns about the proposed ordinance affecting commercial real estate signage, emphasizing the potential impact on business operations. The organization advocated for a thorough review period, requesting ample time—suggested as six months or an appropriate duration—to carefully vet the ordinance before any final decisions are made.\n\nMembers of the Chamber were present at the City Commission Meeting and played a role in influencing the scheduling of agenda items, as noted by Commissioner Fernandez. This involvement underscores the Chamber’s active engagement and influence in shaping policies that affect the local business environment.
