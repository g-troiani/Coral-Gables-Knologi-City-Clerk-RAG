The amendment proposes uniform sign size restrictions across various residential zoning districts (SFR, MF1, MF2, MF3, MF4) and mixed-use districts (MX1, MX2, MX3).

This ordinance specifically targets Article 11, Section 11-107, which governs sign regulations. The agenda item is directly linked to the ordinance (Ordinance E-8), indicating that they represent the same legislative action aimed at modifying existing zoning rules.

This represents a regulatory effort to standardize signage across these districts, likely to maintain neighborhood aesthetics and reduce visual clutter.
