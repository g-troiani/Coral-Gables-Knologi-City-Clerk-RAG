His involvement spans agenda items E-5, E-6, and E-7, indicating a broad scope of influence over property development in this area. Fernandez's role includes advocating for regulatory changes and development rights transfers, positioning him as a key actor in shaping urban planning outcomes.

This change affects lots 8 through 21, excluding the west half of lot 8, and includes addresses such as 3000 Ponce de Leon Blvd and 216 & 224 Catalonia. The ordinance includes provisions for repealer, severability, and an effective date, indicating a comprehensive legal framework for the zoning adjustments. Notably, the ordinance did not receive a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) on December 13, 2013, with a tied vote of 3-3, suggesting some contention or division regarding the changes.

This project is critical in urban planning as it allows for the redistribution of development capacity, potentially preserving certain areas while enabling increased density in others.

These connections illustrate a network of influence where Fernandez’s lobbying activities are directly tied to legislative and regulatory processes affecting the Crafts Section. The agenda items represent discrete points of policy or project focus, while the ordinance embodies a broader regulatory change. Fernandez’s association with both types of entities underscores his multifaceted role in navigating and shaping urban planning frameworks.

MX3 zoning typically allows for greater building heights, increased floor area ratios, and a broader mix of uses compared to MX1. This change can lead to significant transformations in the urban fabric, including increased residential and commercial activity, altered traffic patterns, and changes in community character.
