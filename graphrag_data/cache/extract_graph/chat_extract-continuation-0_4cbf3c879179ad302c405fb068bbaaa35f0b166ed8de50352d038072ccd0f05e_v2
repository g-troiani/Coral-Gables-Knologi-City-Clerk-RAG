This is more of a hybrid based on the input that was gathered during the Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Commissioner Menendez,  I want to give you another opportunity.  Excuse me.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You' re a little funny sometimes but continue.  Another opportunity.  Go. I'm listening.\n\nMayor Lago:  Another opportunity to kind of see it another way.  When Mayor Valdes- Fauli was here,  we used to start the Commission meeting earlier and it was seamless,  and it wasn' t an issue. We had it downstairs.  I think people enjoyed it. It wasn' t an issue. We started 30-45 minutes early. We got here probably at 9:15 and we moved forward pretty quickly.  For some reason I thought that maybe being outside pushed the protocol documents faster,  maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like it was kind of a much faster process.  I said,  let' s get here earlier and let' s get it done.  I'm more than willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning,  at 8:30, get it done,  and we meet the goals of the employees who they stated very clearly by the poll that we took that they would rather have it here and we meet the goal of getting here as quickly as possible and the residents can get here at 9 o' clock, 9:15, to have their items heard in a timely manner without any delays from the protocol section of the meeting.  Does that opportunity work for you?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s definitely one option.  I know we discussed that when this first came up.  Other than presentations and obviously the recognition,  Employee of the Month,  its September so we' re recognizing, is there a way to manage how many protocol items are per Commission meeting?  Can we cap it a little bit better because if you look at it, there are months\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nthat we have an hour-and-a-half, two hours, and then there are other meetings that we have, we' re done in 40 minutes or 35 minutes.  Is there a way to manage what comes before us?\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  There could be. From the employee perspective,  there' s not that many employees that we recognize.  Its an Employee of the Month,  at least from the general employees, right.  So that' s one employee per month,  not including Police and Fire that are recognized every month.  What we tend to do is, we usually save -  so right now we' re in the process of selecting our November,  December and January employees and we are going to bring them before you in February.  So, we usually do about three general employees per Commission meeting every four or five Commission meetings.  As to the protocols,  that all depends.  A lot of the protocols are directed by you all, right.  It' s Disability Awareness Month,  Alzheimer' s Month,  there' s a lot of different types of protocols that HR doesn' t manage,  that usually comes out of one of your offices or one of the different department' s offices.  Can we cap it?  We can cap it, but thenâ€¦\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I have a suggestion.  Can we identify,  just brainstorming,  identify those items that can go in the morning and perhaps have the other ones maybe at noon, split it so that we can start the day getting to work and getting to business.  Have particular identify which ones would be the morning protocols and then at 12 or 12:30 we stop for 30 minutes to do, that way at least we get the day rolling. Otherwise,  we' re all here happy to recognize,  but it really delays the ability to move the agenda.\n\nMayor Lago:  I would support that.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I also have another suggestion as well. We' ve been utilizing it and that is these time certain items. For instance,  the time that there was an 11 o' clock time certain, we paused for a moment,  because it was already 11:15, and I understand that Commissioner Fernandez was presenting at the time,  but we paused for a moment so we could take a speaker who is a businessperson, a resident of our community and allow them to speak.  So,  we as a Commission can better organize our Commission agenda by having time certains for things that people do want to come here and speak on, other than the general time that we have for public comment.  We could even put the general time for public comment as a time certain as well, so people know what time they can come in for the general public comment.  It's just a matter of scheduling.  I deal with schedules every single day when I'm dealing with courts and various people come in and any time that you ignore the overwhelming desire of the Police and Fire people to be recognized in a general meeting where everybody is there,  as opposed to just a resident showing up. And I'm not talking about whether or not this Commission shows up. I'm talking about whether residents are seeing what' s going on, then it is a second- class designation that you give to somebody when they are not in a general meeting itself,  because that' s the purpose here,  to recognize.  You don' t recognize somebody by not including them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think second class is also stating an 11 a.m. time certain,  not taking the item until 11:57. Like we did today to give preference to another item, because we had folks from the\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding official at the City Commission meeting, involved in discussion about meeting scheduling and protocol items.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, city commissioner participating in discussion about managing protocol items and meeting scheduling.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, city commissioner engaging in dialogue during the meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HR DIRECTOR ELEJABARRIETA<|>PERSON<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta, staff member providing information about Employee of the Month recognitions and protocol item management.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, city official suggesting use of time certain items to better organize the Commission agenda.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, city commissioner referenced in discussion about time certain scheduling and agenda item prioritization.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Recognition item for Employee of the Month, recurring agenda item typically involving one general employee per month, excluding Police and Fire recognitions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTOCOL ITEMS<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Various protocol recognitions such as Disability Awareness Month and Alzheimerâ€™s Month, typically directed by different offices or departments, included as agenda items.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIME CERTAIN ITEMS<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda items scheduled at specific times (e.g., 11:00 a.m.) to better organize the meeting and allow public participation.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>Regular meeting of the City Commission where agenda items, protocol recognitions, and public comments are discussed and managed.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICE AND FIRE RECOGNITIONS<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Monthly recognitions for Police and Fire personnel, distinct from general Employee of the Month recognitions.)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
