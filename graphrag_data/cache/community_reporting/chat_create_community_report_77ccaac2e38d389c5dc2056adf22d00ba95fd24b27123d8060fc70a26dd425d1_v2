The Act directly influences zoning parameters such as Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and specific zoning districts in Coral Gables, notably MX2 and MX3.

It establishes requirements and preemptions of local laws, particularly under Section 166.0451 of the Florida Statutes, to standardize local government policies supporting affordable housing initiatives. The Act’s influence extends to local zoning regulations, exemplified by its incorporation into Coral Gables’ Official Zoning Code through Ordinance 23-6828 (Agenda Item E-7), which amended parking standards and other land use provisions. This legislative framework serves as a critical tool for aligning local development policies with state-level affordable housing goals, thereby shaping urban planning and housing availability in Coral Gables and beyond [Data: Entities (155)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Floor Area Ratio (FAR) as a key zoning parameter influenced by the Live Local Act\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is a zoning metric that limits the scale of development by controlling building height and density. In Coral Gables, FAR is capped at a maximum of 3.5 in mixed-use districts, directly affecting urban form and development intensity. The Live Local Act preempts approval processes related to FAR, ensuring that local zoning decisions comply with state mandates aimed at promoting affordable housing. This preemption means that local governments must consider FAR within the framework established by the Act, balancing development scale with housing policy objectives. The dual references to FAR in the community’s data highlight its central role in regulating development under the Act’s influence [Data: Entities (1122, 1220); Relationships (1734, 1890)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"MX2 zoning district’s regulatory characteristics and amendments\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The MX2 zoning district in Coral Gables is characterized by specific regulations on signage size and building height. Prior to recent amendments, signage was limited to a maximum size of 250 square inches, and building height was capped at 70 feet. These restrictions aim to maintain the district’s urban character and control visual impact. The MX2 district is visually represented on GIS maps by a bluish-gray color, distinguishing it from other zones. Amendments to signage size regulations affecting MX2 were made through Agenda Item E-8, reflecting ongoing adjustments to local zoning in response to broader legislative frameworks like the Live Local Act. These changes demonstrate the dynamic nature of zoning controls in managing urban development [Data: Entities (1218); Relationships (2221)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"MX3 zoning district’s regulatory framework and recent changes\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Similar to MX2, the MX3 zoning district in Coral Gables enforces regulations on signage size and building height, with signage restricted to 250 square inches and a higher building height limit of 150 feet. This district is represented in greenish color on GIS maps, helping to differentiate it from other zoning areas. The MX3 district’s height restrictions align with those outlined under the Live Local Act, indicating the Act’s influence on local zoning standards. Like MX2, MX3’s signage regulations were amended by Agenda Item E-8, showing coordinated updates across multiple zoning districts to comply with evolving policy requirements.

This integration reflects the Act’s broader impact on local land use and development standards beyond just housing density and height, extending to parking requirements that influence urban design and development feasibility. The incorporation of state-level legislation into local codes exemplifies the top-down regulatory approach to addressing affordable housing challenges, ensuring consistency across jurisdictions while allowing for local adaptation.
