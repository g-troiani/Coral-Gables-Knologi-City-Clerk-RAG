Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

The term ' publication' or ' publish' means to publish a legal notice in accordance with Floria Statutes, Chapter 50. Publication may be achieved by one of the following: publication in a newspaper, on a publicly accessible website as detailed in Chapter 50 Florida Statutes, or in any other manner so authorized by Florida Statutes, Miami-Dade County, or any other relevant authority.\n\n## Sec. 2-464. - Same-Authority to fix schedule of charges; method of determination.\n\na)The commission shall, in the ordinance or resolution providing for the issuance of sewer revenue bonds,  fix the initial schedule of rates,  fees and other charges for the use of, and for the services and facilities furnished or to be furnished by, the sewage disposal system,  to be paid by the owner,  tenant or occupant of each lot or parcel of land which may be connected with or use any such sewage disposal system or systems by or through any part of the sewer system of the city. After the system shall have been in operation the commission may revise such schedule of rates, fees and charges from time to time.  Such rates, fees and charges shall be so fixed and revised as to provide funds,  with other funds available for such purposes, sufficient at all times to:( 1)Pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the system or systems, including reserves for such purposes and for replacements and depreciation and necessary extensions, and, if the city shall enter into a contract with the City of Miami for the treatment and disposal of\n\nsewage originating in the city,  to pay the cost of such treatment and disposal;(2)Pay the principal of and the interest on the revenue bonds as the same shall become due and reserves therefor; and( 3)Provide a margin of safety for making such payments.\n\nb)The city shall charge and collect the rates,  fees and charges so fixed or revised,  or may contract with the City of Miami to collect such rates, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other commission, board, bureau or agency of the city or of the state or of any sanitary district or other political subdivision of the state.\n\nc)Such rates,  fees and charges shall be just and equitable,  and may be based or computed either upon the quantity of water consumed or upon the number and size of sewer connections or upon the number and kind of plumbing fixtures in use in the premises connected with the sewer system or upon the number or average number of persons residing or working in or otherwise connected with such premises or upon any other factor affecting the use of the facilities furnished or upon any combination of the foregoing factors.\n\nd)Charges for services to premises, including services to manufacturing and industrial plants, may be determined by gauging or metering or in any other manner approved by the commission.\n\ne)In cases where the character of the sewage from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes an unreasonable burden upon any sewage disposal system, an additional charge may be made therefor, or the commission may,  if it deems it advisable, compel such manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises to treat such sewage in such manner as shall be specified by the commission before discharging such sewage into any sewer lines owned or maintained by the city.\n\nf)No rates,  fees or charges shall be fixed under the foregoing provisions of this section until after a public hearing at which all of the users of the sewage disposal system or systems and owners,  tenants or occupants of property served or to be served thereby and all others interested shall have an opportunity to be heard concerning the proposed rates,  fees and charges.  After the adoption by the commission of a resolution setting forth the preliminary schedule or schedules fixing and classifying such rates,  fees and charges,  notice of such public hearing,  setting forth the proposed schedule or schedules of rates,  fees and charges,  shall be given by one publication in a newspaper published in the city at least ten days before the date fixed in such notice for the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time.  After such hearing, such preliminary schedule,  either as originally adopted or as modified or amended,  shall be adopted and put into effect,  and thereupon the ordinance or resolution providing for the issuance of sewer revenue bonds may be finally adopted.  A copy of the schedule of such rates,  fees and charges finally fixed in such ordinance or resolution shall be kept on file in the office of the city manager and shall be open to inspection by all parties interested. The rates, fees or charges so fixed for any class of users or property served shall be extended to cover any additional properties thereafter served which fall within the same class, without the necessity of any hearing or notice. Any change or revision of such rates, fees or charges may be made in the same manner as such rates, fees or charges were originally established as hereinbefore provided, but if such change or revision be made substantially pro rata as to all classes of service no hearing or notice shall be required.\n\n## Sec.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City Commission is the governing body responsible for effectuating the intent of the city through ordinances and resolutions, including fixing schedules of charges related to the sewage disposal system as described in the immediate context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR ISSUANCE OF SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>ORDINANCE/RESOLUTION<|>An ordinance or resolution enacted by the City Commission that provides for the issuance of sewer revenue bonds and fixes the initial schedule of rates, fees, and other charges for the use of the sewage disposal system, including provisions for revision and public hearing requirements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>MONEY<|>Sewer revenue bonds issued under the ordinance or resolution, the proceeds of which are used to fund the sewage disposal system and are subject to payment of principal and interest as described.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM<|>PROJECT<|>The sewage disposal system of the city, which provides services and facilities to owners, tenants, or occupants of lots or parcels of land connected to the system, and for which rates, fees, and charges are fixed and revised by the City Commission.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF MIAMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City of Miami is a neighboring municipality with which the City of Coral Gables may enter into a contract for the treatment and disposal of sewage originating in Coral Gables, as authorized by the City Commission.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC HEARING<|>MEETING<|>A public hearing required before fixing rates, fees, or charges related to the sewage disposal system, where all users and interested parties have the opportunity to be heard, with notice given by publication at least ten days prior.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR ISSUANCE OF SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>The City Commission enacts the ordinance or resolution that provides for the issuance of sewer revenue bonds and fixes the schedule of rates, fees, and charges for the sewage disposal system.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR ISSUANCE OF SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>The ordinance or resolution authorizes the issuance of sewer revenue bonds to fund the sewage disposal system.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR ISSUANCE OF SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM<|>The ordinance or resolution fixes the initial schedule of rates, fees, and charges for the use of the sewage disposal system.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>CITY OF MIAMI<|>The City Commission may enter into a contract with the City of Miami for the treatment and disposal of sewage originating in Coral Gables.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR ISSUANCE OF SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>PUBLIC HEARING<|>Before fixing rates, fees, or charges under the ordinance or resolution, a public hearing must be held to allow users and interested parties to be heard.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM<|>SEWER REVENUE BONDS<|>The rates, fees, and charges fixed under the ordinance or resolution provide funds to pay the principal and interest on the sewer revenue bonds.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
