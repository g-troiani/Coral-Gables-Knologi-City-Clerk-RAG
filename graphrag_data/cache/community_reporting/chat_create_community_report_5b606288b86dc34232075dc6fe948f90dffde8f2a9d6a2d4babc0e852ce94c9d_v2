This amendment authorizes the replacement of an existing building with a new pre-K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables.

The ordinance was discussed at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, and includes provisions for an effective date.\n\nThe second ordinance, referenced by document number 23-6566, involves the approval of a Planned Area Development (PAD) pursuant to Zoning Code Article 14, Section 14-206, for a proposed Publix grocery store and liquor store. This development is planned for the property legally described as Lots 1 through 48, Block 8, Coral Gables Crafts Section, located at 2551 Le Jeune Road, Coral Gables, Florida. The ordinance includes required conditions, a repealer provision, a severability clause, and an effective date. The PZB recommended this ordinance for approval with conditions on November 8, 2023, with a vote of 5-1. The lobbyist associated with this item is Mario Garcia-Serra.

On the same day, for Agenda Item E.-6., the board was unable to reach a consensus and gave no recommendation, also with a 3-3 vote. However, the PZB recommended approval for Agenda Items E.-7. and E.-8. on December 13, 2023, with respective votes of 4-2.
