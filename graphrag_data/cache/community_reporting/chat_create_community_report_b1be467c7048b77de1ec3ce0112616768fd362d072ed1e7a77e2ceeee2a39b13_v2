The program offers varying levels of parking reductions based on proximity to rail stations and parcel size, with reductions ranging from 10% to 100%.

It provides by-right parking reductions up to 25%, with the possibility of up to 100% reduction within 500 feet of rail stations. The program also varies reductions based on parcel size, making it a flexible and targeted approach to encourage transit-oriented development and reduce parking demand. This program serves as a model referenced by stakeholders such as Mr. Fernandez, highlighting its broader relevance in urban planning discussions [Data: Entities (431); Relationships (422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Tiered parking reduction percentages based on proximity to transit\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Urban Center Program establishes a tiered system of parking reductions that depend on the distance from transit stations. The minimum reduction offered is 10%, with a standard by-right reduction of 25%. The maximum reduction of 100% is available for parcels located within 500 feet of rail stations. This tiered approach incentivizes development closer to transit hubs, potentially reducing car dependency and supporting sustainable urban growth. These reduction percentages are codified as distinct entities within the community, reflecting their importance in the program's structure [Data: Entities (452, 453, 454); Relationships (423, 424, 425)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Parcel size categories determine parking reduction eligibility\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The program categorizes parcels into three size groups to determine eligibility for parking reductions: parcels less than 15,000 square feet qualify for up to 100% reduction; parcels between 15,000 and 30,000 square feet qualify for 60% reduction; and parcels greater than 30,000 square feet qualify for 20% reduction. This stratification allows the program to tailor incentives based on the scale of development, encouraging smaller parcels near transit to maximize parking relief while still providing meaningful reductions for larger parcels. These parcel size categories are integral to the program's operational framework [Data: Entities (455, 456, 457); Relationships (426, 427, 428)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Mr. Fernandez's endorsement of the Urban Center Program\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Mr. Fernandez references the Urban Center Program as a model for parking reductions, indicating recognition and potential advocacy for the program's approach beyond its immediate jurisdiction.
