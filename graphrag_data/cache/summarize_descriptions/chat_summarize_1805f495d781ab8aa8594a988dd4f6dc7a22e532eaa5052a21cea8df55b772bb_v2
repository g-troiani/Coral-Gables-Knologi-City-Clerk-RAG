This reduction is granted based on specific criteria, including the size of the property, its proximity to major transit stops, and its compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood. Under the Live Local Act, the City Commission is mandated to consider parking reductions for properties located within a half-mile radius of significant transit stops. The Act also establishes guidelines that limit the extent of reductions, particularly for properties smaller than 6,000 square feet, ensuring that parking requirements remain appropriate to the scale and accessibility of the property. Overall, the PARKING REDUCTION provision aims to promote transit-oriented development and neighborhood compatibility by allowing flexibility in parking requirements where public transit options are readily accessible.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762940, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
