I talked to the head of the Real Estate --  South Florida Real Estate Association,  which is located here in Coral Gables,  adjacent to the fire station.   I know that they' re in opposition of this issue.  Was something that I just thought about right now.  What about for sale by owner?  I bought one property for sale by owner from a lady who, in the building that I was living in, I happened to just walk by and she had this sign in the apartment building,  when I used to live in 100 Edgewater,  over a decade ago. So, I happened to walk by, she was selling it for sale by owner,  I negotiated with her, and I ended up buying the property.   How are we going to address for sale by owner signage,  which I think is something that needs to be considered,  because when you go to, let' s say, Home Depot,  or you go to OfficeMax,  I haven' t been there in a while, but they sell for sale by owner signs.   You can order\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nthem online.   You just have to put your information on it, and how will we address that?   So,  to me,  I think that what I would recommend is that you go back and we speak with multiple community leaders to find a way to bridge the gap and to better understand what are the benefits of this ordinance?   What are we going to get out of it?   Because when we talk about sign pollution, and I'm a huge proponent of it, I've driven with Code Enforcement probably four or five times to try to remove as many signs as possible throughout the City on the trolleys.  I think there' s always an opportunity to reduce sign pollution.   And we have a resident who, I'm not sure if he copies everyone here,  but he probably does,  who sends us probably on a weekly basis signs that are throughout the City that are, you know, blank because of sun exposure that serve no real purpose, three signs in a one-foot radius that make no sense.   And so, I think there' s an opportunity,  but this is a little bit different.   Let us not forget,  let us not forget that when you' re talking about the City of Coral Gables,  our Central Business District accounts for almost 40 percent of our tax base.   So, we need to be very, very, very thoughtful and very methodical when we make certain changes to how people can access the sale and lease of real estate properties here in Coral Gables.   I mean,  I commend you for bringing this forward,  but I think there has to be a lot more discussion,  a lot more opportunity to flush this out.   And as I think as probably the only licensed realtor on this Commission,  I think we really should always engage South Florida real estate community,  the Chamber,  any other community that engages in the sale or transaction of real estate.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   I appreciate the input from my colleagues and from those in the room. I think the reason that a lot of the members of the community and the Commission only learned of this on Friday is because of the timing of the holidays and the release of the agenda.   It's something I've been working with staff since the end of last year.   So, it isn' t something that has just come about in the last few days.   That being said, I think I'm always one to get more input and be open to getting community input on these issues.   And Madam Chair,  would you be willing to host a meeting of your realtors and members of your --  of the Chamber who are willing to sit down and have a conversation with me to discuss potential changes and how we can improve the signage in the Central Business District?\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Okay.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   And I will say something.   I think (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Chair, please come before us, please.\n\nMs. Hernandez: I will say that I think that what Commissioner Menendez said,  it could be that there' s a lot of people breaking the law and not going through the ordinance that is causing,  you know, somebody to come to you and kind of complain.   So, I think I'd be very interested to see what that,  you know, report comes up.   But absolutely,  we will host this and we will bring our community leaders to the table to speak with you.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Okay.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   And anyone else who would like to join.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   So, I would like, if we can do it in the next 30 days,  just to have that conversation.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   I know staff will be working on the Code Enforcement portion of it so that we can,  when we bring it back,  we can have your input taken into account as well.   I know Mr. Trowbridge also told me he wanted a little more time to have conversations with the members. So, always willing to listen to what our business community' s needs are.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Thank you, Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And thank you, Mr. Chamizo and Mr. Adams for being here as well. And the members who actually --  who sent emails.\n\nMr. Chamizo:\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3c5327c5e6d7d15552c50219538f561e915edd6ac69fcd4b5cd16c93fb9838f6_v2"}
