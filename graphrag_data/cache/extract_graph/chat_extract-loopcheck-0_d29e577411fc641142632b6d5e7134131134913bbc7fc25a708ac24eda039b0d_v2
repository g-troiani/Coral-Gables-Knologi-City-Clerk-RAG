They are just going to stick with their car.  So,  if we do significant parking reductions,  which again,  I think we need to do in the future, if we' re really going to be able to address the issue of affordability in our community,  especially for teachers,  police, fire, first responders,  the issue has to be where can we deliver on transportation so that people really,  really don' t need to use vehicles.  So,  he has an interesting concept that he showed me which I recommend that you show it to the other Commissioners that deals with Ponce, facing the Metrorail and it would be something interesting if that Metrorail connected to something for example,  Homestead,  FIU, Miami-Dade College,  Miami Beach,  where people could actually ride transportation and use one modality all the way from work and home. I recommend that you meet with him. Pretty sharp guy.\n\nVice Mayor Lago:  So,  I'm going to dovetail what you said,  because I was down there as well pushing for the rail and more recently you know when I had meetings with our state representatives I said, don' t do what California did and we' re going to end up with urban sprawl and no transportation because people will have to have a car to get somewhere.  If you want to have affordable living, you also have to have affordable transportation.  We always expect these transit services to turn a profit and it's just not realistic.  We always have money for asphalt.  We don' t have enough money for putting in rail and some of the feedback I got was, Tallahassee can' t put money into the rail. We' re really dependent upon the TPO and for the county to fund that program and get it to half, because it needs to go where people need to go. You need to go out to FIU, you need to get to the colleges,  you need to get effectively get to the airport,  because our airport rail is not like the one in Atlanta, New York, DC, where you can walk right out from getting your baggage and hop right on. You haven' t taken it, it's eye-opening to take it. It would be very, very patently obvious to you that it's inadequate in our county.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two other points just to add onto that because it' s all intertwined when you talk about the reduction in parking.  We also in this Commission,  before this Commission,  I'm not sure who, the Vice Mayor and the Commission we' re on, but we also wrote a resolution that I asked to oppose the highway that was being proposed from Homestead,  excuse me, Kendall,  I apologize, that would drop off next to my office there near Blue Lagoon.  They were talking about potentially having a savings of six or seven minutes on a commute,  but it was a billion-dollar highway program. We as a city, along with five or six other cities, we were the ones, we wrote the resolution.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nWe went to the county in an effort to stop that - stop that and invest that money in real rail. Invest that money in real infrastructure that will deliver and remove cars from the streets.  And the second point that I think is critical, this is just since we' re talking here amongst the Commission,  we never get to do this, we might as well do it now, I think its important is we have to be very, very strict and we have to oppose moving the UDB line. Do not move the UDB line, to me, its catastrophic. I think we need to go vertical before we do more urban sprawl.  Like you said,  it's all investing. When you move the UDB line, its more asphalt and its more infrastructure that needs to be spent when you should be spending that money in the urban core to really have affordability,  because people are tired of driving two and three hours to work, the cost is significant.  It's interesting.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: During our trip to Tallahassee, we did have a conversation with Commissioner Higgins regarding the county' s plans and the work that they are doing right now to expand the Metro Mover out west to FIU and there was an appetite at the time,  or I guess now from Tallahassee to help fund these projects.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I'm going to ask you to clarify, Mover or Rail.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Mover.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s a long route for the Mover.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: It is a long route for the Mover,  but it is something that they are currently have commitments from Washington for funding for. So,  it is something that they are working on, and it looks like it has legs and will be able to move eventually.  There are those on the County Commission and in Tallahassee who are looking to maybe expand even further out west and further southwest,  but it is something that they are currently working on, and they look like they' d be able to get something done in the next couple of years.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Interesting.  My husband worked for the Mover,  that' s basically a bus on top of a platform,  its rubber tires.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s why I'm saying that' s a really long route for them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It is, and I guess that' s the way that they decided to move.  My dad actually was a quality assurance engineer for the Metro Mover for many years.  He worked with our ACM when he was there in transit.
