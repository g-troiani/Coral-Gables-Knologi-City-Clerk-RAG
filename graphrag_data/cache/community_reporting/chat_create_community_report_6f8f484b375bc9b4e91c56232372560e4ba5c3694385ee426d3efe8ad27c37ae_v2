In August 2023, Elejabarrieta reported the results of a survey that gauged employee preferences for recognition ceremonies, revealing a near-even split between those favoring recognition before the City Commission (205 employees) and those preferring a separate ceremony (174 employees). This indicates a nuanced understanding of employee sentiment and a data-driven approach to recognition programs. Additionally, Elejabarrieta manages protocols during meetings, ensuring that procedures are properly coordinated and executed, which underscores the collaborative nature of her role across various offices and departments.

Furthermore, Suarez confirmed that the employee recognition survey was conducted by Human Resources, reinforcing the legitimacy of the data used in administrative decisions. Suarez also outlined the Commission's role in approving parking reductions based on development impact and neighborhood character, illustrating a broader legal oversight function.
