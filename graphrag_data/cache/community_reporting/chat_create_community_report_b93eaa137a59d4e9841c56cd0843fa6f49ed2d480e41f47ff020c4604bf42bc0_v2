This property is notable because it is suspected to be used as a school or educational facility, which has led to increased activity and parking issues in the neighborhood. The proximity of this property—approximately 130 feet from the complainants’ property line—has intensified local concerns about neighborhood disruption and encroachment.

This indicates that the Board’s role is more regulatory and supervisory, delegating maintenance duties to individual owners.
