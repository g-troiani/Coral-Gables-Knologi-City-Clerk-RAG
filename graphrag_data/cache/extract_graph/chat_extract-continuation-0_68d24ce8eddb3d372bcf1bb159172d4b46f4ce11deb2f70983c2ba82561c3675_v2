I would love to have Miracle Mile be a go-to place in the holiday season for folks to come to Miracle Mile to see.  In my perfect world, Miracle Mile should glow during the winter, during the holidays,  glow, and people like, hey, let' s drive to Coral Gables Miracle Mile so we can just see how beautifully lit and create sort of a winter wonderland concept. I think that' s what -  without that we can put all the decorations possible on trees and it will look like Charlie Brown' s Christmas Tree which sort of you know,  tips over.  I would like to create, what is it, the wow. I want people to feel wow and the lighting is the key,  I think,  and since the Mayor did mention that we have Commissioner Castro,  Commissioner Fernandez weren' t here when the whole BID, not now, but could you or somebody maybe in February give a history of the responsibilities for Miracle Mile and how we now transition to the city doing it. So,  I think I want to fill in any gaps,  because now, obviously,  we' re tasked with it and we all want to put our best foot forward,  but if you could do just a brief how we got here, that would be helpful.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  So, I'm going to dovetail. As I handed out to you, this was a communication with residents,  and it was on Next-door, so I want to make sureâ€¦\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Very popular topic on Next-door.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I make sure I put my communications back to the residents.  What they would like, the main complaint there was lack of color.  This was an invitation that I sent to them to participate and there is a willingness of residents to participate,  but our history on trying to do something with Miracle Mile goes back when the BID was here,  Slesnick came in and visited every single one of us who was in office at the time,  basically imploring us to dress up Miracle Mile. I brought in pictures from Winter Park' s main drag,  showing what they had done.  People want some color, people want some flash to show there, but we don' t want it too bright either.  So, maybe I don' t know if we need to dim down some of the other lights so that the decorations are the showcase.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  No sunglasses needed.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No sunglasses needed.  So,  some of those vertical poles when we talked about Calvin rating, I don' t know if we can either through a film or something to kind of tone them down a little bit so its not hard to look at, so that the lights on the trees and the decorations on the trees are the center of focus,  as opposed to the glare that you get from some of the lights on the Mile in one corner and some of the crosswalk areas.  So, I just wanted to share this communication with you all, with the residents,  they are interested in participating.  You might get a reach out from them saying,  here' s our ideas and we all collaborate and get a better pizza, so-to-speak.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I also think it' s important to keep in mind that while we want something at night, we do need to get a good bang for our dollar too, and make sure that they are really impactful in the daytime.  Just keep that in mind as well,  because we do have a big population in the daytime,  and we want to make sure that they enjoy it also.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Thank you.\n\n=== END OF ITEM F-5 TRANSCRIPT ===\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Miracle Mile<|>project<|>Miracle Mile, a prominent commercial and community area in Coral Gables, envisioned as a festive winter wonderland during the holiday season with enhanced lighting and decorations to attract visitors and create a \"wow\" effect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>person<|>Mayor Lago, the Mayor of Coral Gables, who referenced the importance of Miracle Mile as a holiday destination and participated in the City Commission Meeting discussion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Castro<|>person<|>Commissioner Castro, a City Commissioner mentioned in the context of Miracle Mile and its Business Improvement District (BID) history.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>person<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a City Commissioner who participated in the discussion about Miracle Mile and noted the popularity of the topic on Next-door.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>person<|>Commissioner Menendez, a City Commissioner who contributed to the discussion with a lighthearted comment about lighting on Miracle Mile.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>person<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, the Vice Mayor of Coral Gables, who shared communications with residents about Miracle Mile and discussed lighting and decoration strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Economic Development Director Perez<|>person<|>Economic Development Director Perez, who emphasized the importance of cost-effectiveness and impact of Miracle Mile decorations both at night and during the daytime.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>meeting<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, where Miracle Mile holiday lighting and decorations were discussed by city officials and commissioners.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Miracle Mile<|>Mayor Lago referenced Miracle Mile as a key location to be a holiday destination and emphasized the importance of lighting to create a \"wow\" effect.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Castro<|>Miracle Mile<|>Commissioner Castro was mentioned in relation to the history of the Miracle Mile Business Improvement District and its responsibilities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Miracle Mile<|>Commissioner Fernandez discussed the popularity of Miracle Mile holiday decorations on Next-door and participated in the meeting discussion.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Miracle Mile<|>Commissioner Menendez contributed to the discussion about lighting on Miracle Mile with a comment about no sunglasses needed.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Miracle Mile<|>Vice Mayor Anderson shared resident communications and discussed lighting and decoration strategies for Miracle Mile.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Economic Development Director Perez<|>Miracle Mile<|>Economic Development Director Perez emphasized the need for impactful and cost-effective decorations for Miracle Mile.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Mayor Lago<|>Mayor Lago participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024 discussing Miracle Mile.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Commissioner Castro<|>Commissioner Castro was referenced during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024 regarding Miracle Mile.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Commissioner Fernandez participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024 discussing Miracle Mile.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Commissioner Menendez participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024 discussing Miracle Mile.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Vice Mayor Anderson led communications and discussion during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024 about Miracle Mile.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Economic Development Director Perez<|>Economic Development Director Perez contributed to the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024 discussing Miracle Mile.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
