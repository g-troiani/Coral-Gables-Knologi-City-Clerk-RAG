Basically,  they were hand made for us, so the ornaments that are hanging from the trees and the ones that are on the median,  the stars that are on the median,  that is the only thing that we will continue with for the next three years.  So, two more years we' ve got of that. And then everything else,  so about $ 64,000, we have the ability to go out and we are going to go out to get bids for the rest of those decorations.  We did that because we, you know, I hear you Commissioner,  but I think decorations are really subjective.  Some people could like it, some people not,  and so we really wanted to start with a pallet where you could see decorations.  Last year the ones that we had were one ornament per block,  that' s the only thing we were able to get, and it was lit at night as well, also had a lighting component to it, but there was only one per block. I really don' t think that was enough for the street.  I don' t think it was significant enough for the type of street that we have.\n\nMayor Lago: If I may, if you would educate the Commission.  Over the last few years, we' ve been talking about the lack of lighting,  full-time lighting throughout the year of the oak trees,  and obviously,  Christmas Tree lighting.  That to me, has been,  I think is priority number one.  When you talk about Christmas -  the ornaments are beautiful,  I want to see lights.  I want to see lights hanging from the oak trees.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  You mean like the full year.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  I wouldn' t have an issue with it. I don' t have an issue with it. But that' s something that people have talked to me about it,  and it makes a lot of sense.  We could do something beautiful,  well done, tasteful,  doesn' t have to be bright neon.  It could be a softer color, but I think that it would benefit the street significantly and it would give a festive kind of feel to it throughout\n\nCity Commission Meeting the year.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  The lighting is really what detracted from the decorations,  because you couldn' t even see them. The stars on the palm trees, I was hard-pressed to find them, because you could see where they were.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  At night.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  So, two things.  The string lights that are on the trees that are on Miracle Mile, the swales,  they are currently lit only up to the trunk.  So, this was a project that was put in place to replace those,  that was a project that had been started by the former Business Improvement District.  They paid 50 percent of it. We are picking it up as part of the budget process.  We did ask for the $79,000 that it would cost to complete that project,  and so,  I did receive that.  That is going to be a project that' s going to start in February.  We didn' t want to do it in the middle of the holiday season,  because we weren' t sure when it would be done, and so because our budget just started in October,  we wanted to have enough time to be able to have it. So that' s a year- round lighting that would be installed,  and we have talked to that vendor,  and they know that they need to go up some of the branches.  I'm not sure how many string lights were purchased,  because it' s not our project,  but we want to go up.\n\nMayor Lago:  But this is something that we' ve been talking about,  Commissioner,  for two years. I know the BID fell apart and everything that happened,  but I want to make sure that we deliver on that this year, if possible.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I had a lot of feedback and even in our comments in the community and I think the Mayor was touching upon it. I would love to have Miracle Mile be a go-to place in the holiday season for folks to come to Miracle Mile to see.  In my perfect world, Miracle Mile should glow during the winter, during the holidays,  glow, and people like, hey, let' s drive to Coral Gables Miracle Mile so we can just see how beautifully lit and create sort of a winter wonderland concept. I think that' s what -  without that we can put all the decorations possible on trees and it will look like Charlie Brown' s Christmas Tree which sort of you know,  tips over.  I would like to create, what is it, the wow. I want people to feel wow and the lighting is the key,  I think,  and since the Mayor did mention that we have Commissioner Castro,  Commissioner Fernandez weren' t here when the whole BID, not now, but could you or somebody maybe in February give a history of the responsibilities for Miracle Mile and\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the mayor participating in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, discussing budget and lighting priorities for Miracle Mile and the park)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR PEREZ<|>PERSON<|>Economic Development Director Perez, city official responsible for managing the Miracle Mile and Giralda holiday decorations budget and projects, providing updates on expenditures and lighting projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a city commissioner attending the meeting, providing feedback on the lighting and decorations on Miracle Mile)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a city commissioner advocating for enhanced lighting and decorations on Miracle Mile to create a festive and attractive holiday environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, a city commissioner mentioned by Commissioner Menendez in relation to the history of the Business Improvement District (BID) for Miracle Mile)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRACLE MILE<|>PROJECT<|>Miracle Mile, a prominent street in Coral Gables targeted for holiday decorations and year-round lighting improvements to enhance its appeal during the holiday season and throughout the year)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIRALDA<|>PROJECT<|>Giralda, an area associated with Miracle Mile where holiday decorations were installed, including ornaments and lighting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLIDAY DECORATIONS<|>PROJECT<|>Holiday decorations installed on Miracle Mile and Giralda, including handmade ornaments hanging from trees and medians, with a budget of approximately $147,000 out of $150,000 allocated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORNAMENTS<|>PROJECT<|>Ornaments for holiday decorations on Miracle Mile and Giralda, some handmade and purchased to be used for the next three years, including stars on the median and tree decorations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAR-ROUND LIGHTING PROJECT<|>PROJECT<|>A project to install full-year lighting on the oak trees along Miracle Mile, replacing existing string lights that currently only light up to the trunk;
