-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- title: Name of the entity, capitalized
- type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Examples-
Entity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION
Text: "Commissioner Smith moved to approve Ordinance 2024-01 relating to agenda item E-1."
Output:
("entity"<|>SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Smith, a member of the city commission who made a motion)
{record_delimiter}
("entity"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, a city ordinance being considered for approval)
{record_delimiter}
("entity"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, an item on the meeting agenda that ordinance 2024-01 relates to)
{record_delimiter}
("relationship"<|>SMITH<|>2024-01<|>Commissioner Smith moved to approve Ordinance 2024-01<|>8)
{record_delimiter}
("relationship"<|>2024-01<|>E-1<|>Ordinance 2024-01 relates to agenda item E-1<|>9)
{completion_delimiter}

-Real Data-
Entity types: {entity_types}
Text: {input_text}
Output:
