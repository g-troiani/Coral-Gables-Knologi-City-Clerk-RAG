It plays a central role in zoning and land use regulation, including consideration of zoning code elements such as Floor Area Ratio (FAR), open space, and parking requirements. However, its authority is limited by the Live Local Act, which preempts the Commission on matters of use, height, and density.\n\nThe Commission conducts first and second public hearings for the adoption of ordinances, including zoning and land use amendments, ensuring compliance with specified notice requirements. It reviews and decides on Zoning in Progress Resolutions, makes preliminary findings, approves or denies proposed resolutions, orders moratoriums, and may extend resolution periods. Public hearings are regularly held to consider applications related to zoning, signage, dredging, filling, and construction permits, with a particular emphasis on environmental considerations such as biological and ecological studies. The Commission must approve all applications for permits involving construction on submerged or tidal lands, subject to other agency consents.\n\nIn addition to zoning and land use matters, the City Commission is responsible for adopting ordinances and resolutions that affect various aspects of city governance. For example, it enacted Ordinance No. 2024-02, which amended sections of the City Code related to legal notices and publication requirements, and Ordinance No. 2024-03, which involved legislative determinations for specific agenda items. The Commission also passed Resolution No. 2024-06 authorizing access to a piggyback contract for firefighting equipment, and other resolutions appointing members to advisory boards, such as the Senior Citizens Advisory Board and confirming appointments like that of John \"\"Miles\"\" Maronto.\n\nThe Commission oversees election-related responsibilities, including appointing members and alternate members to the canvassing board, adopting resolutions to accept certified election results, and delegating appointment authority in emergencies. It ensures that canvassing board members are impartial, including individuals who are not candidates with opposition in the election being canvassed.\n\nThe City Commission also addresses community concerns such as residential parking, swale landscaping, neighborhood parking issues, and park usage. It discusses and regulates signage, including matters related to real estate sales and sign pollution, and manages scheduling and ceremonial functions within the city.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission is authorized to establish or modify city facilities by resolution and direct their operations without regard to zoning classifications. It holds public hearings to authorize construction, modification, or operation of city facilities and grants approval for Class 1 permits submitted by upland property owners.\n\nThroughout its activities, the City Commission receives advice and recommendations from the City Manager, Development Review Committee, Planning and Zoning Board, and City Attorney.
