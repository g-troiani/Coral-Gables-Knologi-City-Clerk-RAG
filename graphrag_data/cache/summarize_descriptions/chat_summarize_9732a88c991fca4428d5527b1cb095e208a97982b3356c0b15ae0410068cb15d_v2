These parents, who have children attending the school, are the primary recipients of newsletters that regularly remind them about parking rules, particularly the restrictions on parking on swales. They are encouraged through these communications to avoid parking in prohibited areas to help alleviate traffic issues. Neighbors have identified these parents as the main contributors to driveway blockages and traffic problems near Salvadore Park and the school property, clarifying that the issues are not caused by users of the dog park or pickleball players.
