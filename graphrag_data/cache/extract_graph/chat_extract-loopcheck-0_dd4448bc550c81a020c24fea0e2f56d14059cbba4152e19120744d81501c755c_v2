I think live oaks;  he was talking about the two-degree temperature change would probably kill off most of our live oak trees.  So,  I just wanted to put that on everybody' s radar and maybe have the city have a conversation with Dr. Feely and make sure that if we are changing and doing a tree succession that we do take into account potential changes to temperature to make sure that five or ten years down the road if we do have an impact of a couple of years of two-degree or three-degree change to our temperature,  we don' t lose a lot of our tree canopy.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you respond,  could you give us a little bit of background in regard to the existing tree replacement program that we' ve had going on for the last,  I don' t know,  almost a decade.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Absolutely. Hello Commission, Mayor,  I'm Deena BellLlewelyn,  Greenspace Management from Public Works, for the record. Our current tree succession project we launch every year, we have a Commission- fed budget of $200,000 per year for that tree succession project every year.  Right now, there' s 2023 project is coming out of Procurement.  We intend to award it to the contractor,  hopefully within the next week or two to start replanting 111 total trees,  as part of this year' s project,  and as soon as we finish this one,  we roll right into next year where we already have hopefully 90 to 100 trees ready to plan.  We put this out to bid with contractors,  because the size of the project is large.  So, it buys about 100 trees a year on average.\n\nMayor Lago:  And if you go right now to, I was there last week,  if you go to our Public Works Department where the actual yard, you' ll get to see a lot of the oak trees that are basically ready to be transplanted from that office to the area where they are going to be relocated forever in the city. So, you can see all the trees are basically ready there for the contractor to take them to plant them somewhere in the neighborhoods.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Right. And in our Public Works yard we have about 40 oaks. We' re trying to green them up with more water before we plant them.  They dropped all their leaves,  and they are a little brown for our taste, so we' re waiting for them to green up.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  I used to do that by sinking them in six inches of water or more,  because they can tolerate about six weeks'  worth of being in standing water,  any of the ones that went into shock and then I would see the growth,  but right now they are dropping their leaves anyway.  So, a lot\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F-6<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item labeled F-6 discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning tree canopy replacement and related environmental issues.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>01_09_2024 - Verbatim Transcripts - F-6.pdf<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Document identifier for the verbatim transcript of the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, covering agenda item F-6.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, at City Commission Chambers, Coral Gables, FL, discussing agenda item F-6.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vince Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor of Coral Gables City Commission present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Rhonda Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor of Coral Gables City Commission present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Melissa Castro<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables City Commission present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ariel Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables City Commission who sponsored agenda item F-6 at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Kirk Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner of Coral Gables City Commission present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cristina Su√°rez<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney for Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Peter Iglesias<|>PERSON<|>City Manager for Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Billy Urquia<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk for Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Deena Bell-Llewelyn<|>PERSON<|>Greenspace Management Director from Public Works Department, Coral Gables, providing information about the tree succession project during the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Public Works Department<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City of Coral Gables department responsible for public works, including tree succession and maintenance.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>University of Miami<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Academic institution referenced during the meeting, represented by Dr. Feely who presented on tree canopy and temperature impacts.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Rotary Club<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Community organization mentioned as the venue where Dr. Feely gave a presentation relevant to agenda item F-6.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Tree Succession Project<|>PROJECT<|>Annual city project funded with a $200,000 budget to replace and replant trees in Coral Gables, discussed in relation to agenda item F-6.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>F-6 Discussion Transcript<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Verbatim transcript document capturing the discussion of agenda item F-6 at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-6<|>F-6 Discussion Transcript<|>The agenda item F-6 is the subject of the verbatim transcript document capturing its discussion.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-6<|>Tree Succession Project<|>Agenda item F-6 discussion centers on the tree succession project and tree canopy replacement efforts.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Deena Bell-Llewelyn<|>Tree Succession Project<|>Deena Bell-Llewelyn, as Greenspace Management Director, provides detailed information about the tree succession project during the meeting.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Ariel Fernandez<|>F-6<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez sponsored and led the discussion on agenda item F-6.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>University of Miami<|>F-6<|>Dr. Feely from University of Miami gave a presentation referenced during the discussion of agenda item F-6.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Rotary Club<|>University of Miami<|>Dr. Feely's presentation at the Rotary Club meeting was referenced during the F-6 discussion.<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Public Works Department<|>Tree Succession Project<|>Public Works Department manages and executes the tree succession project discussed under agenda item F-6.<|>9)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
