It encompasses multiple zoning districts, including MX1, MX2, and MX3, and is strategically located along the U.S.-1 corridor and near the urban center adjacent to the City of South Miami. This district is subject to specific height and density regulations that aim to balance residential, commercial, and innovation-focused uses, promoting sustainable growth and diverse housing options. The district's regulatory framework is shaped by the Live Local Act, which influences height and density limits to support affordable housing and controlled urban expansion [Data: Entities (1115, 1131, 1118, 1119, 1139, 1126); Relationships (1723, 1725, 1726, 1727)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Height limitations as a key regulatory mechanism\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Height limitations are a fundamental aspect of the zoning regulations within the community, specifically affecting the MX2 and MX3 districts. The MX2 district is limited to a maximum building height of 70 feet, while the MX3 district allows up to 150 feet. These height caps are designed to control the scale and density of development, preserving the character of the district and preventing overbuilding. The Live Local Act plays a significant role by allowing the highest permissible height within one mile, which provides some flexibility while maintaining overall regulatory control.
