Specifically, through Resolution 24-7077, the Board sought approval to allow individuals who work within the City of Coral Gables, but do not reside there, to be eligible for nomination and service on the Retirement Board. This request emphasizes that employment within the city should suffice for qualification, thereby removing the necessity for members to live in Coral Gables. The Board’s position, as conveyed in multiple communications and resolutions, consistently advocates for this adjustment to the residency criteria to broaden the pool of qualified candidates who contribute to the governance of the city’s retirement system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844112, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
