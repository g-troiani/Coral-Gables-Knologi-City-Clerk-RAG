I've even had it on the garage,  and they' ve complied through Code Enforcement.  How did we get it done before?\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Ceballos:  So, I personally have never had to deal with that particular issue before. What I can do is I can find out from Code Enforcement how they' ve handled it in the past.  I can let you know. I can look into it for you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Isn' t it also a fire code issue?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Just to give - that' s one of my major concerns and the reason that I'm putting this in here.  I know that it is a major fire issue.  I've driven through parts of North Gables where you have homes that have shutters on every single opening that' s visible from the street.  I also think we are trying to keep a look for our city, we go through this lengthy approval process to make sure that homes look good and look appropriate for Code Enforcement,  and this is one thing. I understand during hurricane season sometimes you have that first storm that comes up, you put up your shutters,  and it is cumbersome and difficult to remove them.  We have folks who don' t necessarily have the ability to do it themselves and have to rely on family members.  So,  what I wanted to do was give a buffer so that you have through the end of hurricane season and possibly a storm that lingers after hurricane season and give a two-week cushion after that last storm or after the end of hurricane season for folks to take them down.  I think after hurricane seasons complete those shutters should be taken down for the reasons that have been addressed.\n\nMayor Lago:  Any public comment,  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have a question.  I don' t see a warning procedure in here. Most things that we deal with, and this is not a life - we usually have a warning procedure.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, this isn' t sending a specific enforcement mechanism in this ordinance. It would revert to our standard,  which is we can always issue a warning.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Some of these -  I can understand why there' s not a warning on some of the items here listed, but I would like a warning.  Homeowners Association always tells somebody you have 30-35 days to take them down otherwise XYZ penalty will be imposed.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm willing to bet that when you think about it, the person who probably has their shutters up for a long time is an elderly person.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  Who paid somebody to put their shutters up or a daughter or son to go and put their shutters up,  they don' t live in Miami- Dade County or they do, but they are busy with their own\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nlives and they haven' t been able to get to it, because its an endeavor and you are talking about somebody you hit them with another $ 500 fine right off the bat, its tough, you know, and then we get the call and its like, you know how it works, its like we send it to you and show leniency,  this person is 90 years old, what do we do.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Miami Lakes had the same sort of thing, and I was the shutter- installer,  so I had to make time.\n\nMayor Lago:  Or the person is disabled,  good example.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not an easy process.  I've done it and it's not fun.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No, no, its not fun, that' s why I think at least 30 days.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.  I thought there was a provision that we would fall back on, that was my understanding.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, a Code Enforcement Officer always has the ability to issue a warning before enforcement. If the Commission wants to mandate in this particular regulation that a warning must be issued first, we can certainly incorporate that into it.\n\nMayor Lago:  If the sponsor would allow me. I would want to make sure that that' s memorialized because at the end of the day,  I'm pretty sure we' re dealing with elderly people,  older people, disabled people who, I don' t think anybody wants to live in their house completely shuddered like that, you don' t see any sunlight.  I don' t think it' s a very pleasant situation.  So, I think those people probably need to be pushed or helped in one way or another to get those shutters off.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'd be happy to amend it to add a 30-day warning as the first course of action from the city.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Mr. Clerk, do we have any public comment\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY MANAGER IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Iglesias, official speaking about building code and fire code issues related to unsafe structures and ventilation concerns.
