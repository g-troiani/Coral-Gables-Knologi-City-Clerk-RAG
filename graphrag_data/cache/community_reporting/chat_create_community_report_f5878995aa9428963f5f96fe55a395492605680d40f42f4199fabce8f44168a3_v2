The process begins with an Applicant submitting an Application to the public works department, which includes detailed documentation and plans. The Application requires certifications from a Registered Engineer and is subject to review and approval by the City Commission before a Permit is issued. The Permit then authorizes Construction Work, which encompasses various shore-related structures and activities. These entities are interconnected through formal relationships that ensure compliance with city regulations and oversight of construction projects.\",\n  \"rating\": 6.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderately high due to the community's role in regulating construction activities that can significantly affect urban development, environmental compliance, and public safety.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Application as the foundational regulatory submission\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Application entity represents a formal submission made by an individual or entity to the city public works department, serving as the critical first step in the regulatory process for construction and shore-related projects. It requires comprehensive documentation, including ownership evidence, detailed plans, and certifications, ensuring that all necessary information is provided for regulatory review. The Application is subject to rejection if a similar request has been considered within the past year, which helps prevent redundant or repetitive submissions and streamlines the review process.
