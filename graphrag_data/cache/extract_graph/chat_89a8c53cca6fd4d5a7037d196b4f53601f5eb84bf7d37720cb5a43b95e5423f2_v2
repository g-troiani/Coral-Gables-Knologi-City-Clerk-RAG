If the plans are to expand,  I do have concerns because there is no parking there and that will be something that must be addressed. But I think the Mayor brought up a very good point of including the Manager in this conversation and the City Attorney,  because I think it' s also encumbered upon us in the City if we have made all these improvements on Salvadore Park,  that we are not creating more problems for the neighbors in the area and that we are part of finding a solution.   So, I think it' s something that we need to work together,  City,  the school,  and the neighbors on finding a solution that works for everybody.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner Menendez.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Thank you, Mayor.   Speaking of Salvadore Park,  I drove by the other evening,  and I noticed a great many cars parked,  I guess,  next to the dog park.   Is that --  have we\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nalways had folks parking --?   Because it' s not --  it' s dirt basically,  between the playground area and the dog park.  I just see there are parks there --  cars everywhere parked.   I don' t know if that' s officially a parking spot or…\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' re looking --  I've already talked to -- after the dog park we opened the dog park, I noticed that that was a mud area,  and I've already talked to Public Works about changing that into some type of rock, like a granite, so that it can be used as a parking area,  yet not turn it into asphalt.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Okay,  because it is pretty clear that people are looking for parking spots where there aren' t any.   And I don' t recall in the past seeing cars there.   I too have --  I feel the same way.   The project in and of itself,  I think it' s a wonderful project,  well presented,  well thought out for all the right reasons,  but the fact that the different parties haven' t come to a meeting of the minds taints the whole process. We should be here celebrating a wonderful project that everybody can embrace,  but unfortunately,  there are a lot of loose ends.   So, that' s not a positive, not only with this item,  but with any item that comes before the City Commission. We' ve had plenty of items that just seem to sometimes unravel because one string is loose,  they pull and everything comes apart.   So, let' s try to avoid that.  I have a couple questions for, I guess,  the City Attorney.   Is -- so, the number of students that are allowed,  let' s start there.   That' s written where in terms of…\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  In their prior approval,  and there' s a recorded covenant as well.  So --  and they' re not asking for an amendment to that or a change in connection…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And I understand.\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSuÆrez:  With this amendment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: Exactly. And I'm not saying they are or that they will,  but to understand the legal ramifications of that agreement or that document,  what happens if a school does expand?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  They would have to come before you and request that. You would all review it and request approval of an amendment to their prior approvals.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And if we find out that they' ve added a hundred more students or 50 more students,  then what would the City have?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So, they have to -- and maybe the planner can come up, but I think annually they submit an affidavit.   Isn' t that…?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   City Planner,  Jennifer Garcia.   So,  they --  I believe they submit something every single year, every single school year to…\n\nMs. Russo:   I think it's done toward the middle of September.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:  ( INAUDIBLE)  every January.\n\nMs. Russo:   January.\n\nCity Planner\n\nGarcia:   January,  okay.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:   We send a letter ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Right.\n\nMs. Russo:   Right,  each school has it a little bit differently. I think some have it at the end of September,  but all the schools I've represented that have student limitations provide an annual affidavit on the student enrollment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   So, it's a viable legal binding agreement.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   Correct.   And if there was a violation,  then we would take action to enforce the covenant is what we would do.  That would be our recourse.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: And I agree,  there are other schools,  I know the charter school on Segovia,  when they were approved,  all the schools have their limitations.\n\nMs. Russo:   Gulliver,  St. Thomas also have student…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   But I know people are watching,  they want to know, well, is it binding? So, that' s good to know.  In terms of the footprint of the school,  Madam City Attorney,  when 2002 there were agreements,  things that were approved,  was the footprint of the school limited\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_89a8c53cca6fd4d5a7037d196b4f53601f5eb84bf7d37720cb5a43b95e5423f2_v2"}
