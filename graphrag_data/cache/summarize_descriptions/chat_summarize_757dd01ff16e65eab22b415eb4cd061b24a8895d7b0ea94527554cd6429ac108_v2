According to Sarah Hernandez, the DBPR's compliance standards are directly affected by proposed reductions in signage size. The DBPR mandates specific language to be included on signs for properties that are for sale, lease, or rent. These detailed language requirements often make it challenging to fit all the necessary information onto smaller signs, thereby complicating compliance when signage dimensions are reduced. Overall, the DBPR plays a critical role in regulating the content and size of commercial property signage to ensure clear and consistent communication in the real estate market.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840859, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 270, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
