identify all entities and their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

Except as expressly provided hereinafter, all utility lines,  including, but not limited to,  those required for electrical power distribution, and those such lines, cables, and conduits for telephone, and communication, street lighting,  and video service shall be installed underground.  This section shall apply to all cables,  conduits or wires forming part of an electrical distribution system including service lines to individual properties and main feeder and lateral distribution electric lines delivering power to local distribution systems, provided that it shall not apply to wires, conductors or associated apparatus and supporting structures whose exclusive function is in transmission of electrical energy between generating stations,  substations,  and transmission lines of other utility systems.  City installed utility lines and poles shall not be subject to the provisions of this article,  including,  but not limited to,  city-owned network infrastructure. Appurtenances to support underground utility lines,  cables,  conduits,  and other equipment such as transformers, pedestal and pad-mounted terminal boxes, and meter cabinets, may be located above ground in appropriate utility easements and in conformance with the requirements of the public works department.  This section 78-281 shall be applicable to the following uses:( 1)Except for rehabilitation of structures of less than 50 percent of value,  all new\n\nconstruction and utility and communications installations shall be required to be underground.( 2)When a structure undergoes a rehabilitation wherein the cost of the rehabilitation is 50 percent or more of the replacement value of the existing structure as determined by the Miami- Dade County Property Appraiser, utility and communications service facilities for that structure shall be converted from overhead to underground.\n\nc)Conversion of overhead to underground facilities.  Whenever overhead utility lines or distribution facilities have been converted to underground facilities,  the following shall be required:(1)The property owners in the area to be served by the new facilities shall be required to arrange for the conversion of their existing service facilities in accordance with these regulations and, where applicable, utility company specifications for underground service.
