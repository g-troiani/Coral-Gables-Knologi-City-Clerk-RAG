Back in 2001 through 2003,  St. Philip' s underwent a master plan process.   And in that process,  it was proposing a new building,  but during that process,  it underwent a total review of its operations.   Conditions were imposed,  limiting the number of students,  setting up the drop-off operation,  legislating certain landscaping,  making sure that any changes to a site plan would go before a public hearing process, making decisions with respect to colors of the building so that the school would blend into the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential neighborhood,  parking for employees in the lot to the east of Salvadore Park,  and also dealing with special event permits for the special events\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-4<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-4 discussed at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning amendments to St. Philip's School site plan.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Permanent ordinance number approving the original St. Philip's School site plan.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ordinance No. 3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Permanent ordinance number approving the original St. Philip's School site plan for St. Philip's School.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ordinance 2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Filing number for ordinance amending Ordinance No. 3576 related to agenda item E-4.
