Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user said it can be anywhere, so I have to check every page. Let me start skimming through the text.

Looking at the first part, there's the ordinance number and some sections being amended. Then in the WHEREAS clauses, but no agenda item there. The main body has sections 1 through 7, but still no code. 

Wait, near the end of the document, after the sections, there's a part that says "PASSEDANDADOPTED THISNINTHDAYOFJANUARY..." and then "AgendaItem: E-3)". That looks like the format mentioned. Let me check again. 

Yes, in the section where the vote is recorded, right after the Yeas and the Unanimous vote, it says "AgendaItem: E-3)". The hyphen is there, so the code is E-3. Let me make sure there's no other instances. Scanning the rest, including the exhibits and signatures, I don't see another code. So the answer should be E-3.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-3
