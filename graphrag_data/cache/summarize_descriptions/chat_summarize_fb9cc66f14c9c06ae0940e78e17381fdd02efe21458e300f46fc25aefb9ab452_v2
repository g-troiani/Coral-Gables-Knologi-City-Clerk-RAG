The rates fixed by the ordinance or resolution apply uniformly to all properties within the same classification without the need for additional hearings or notices. Any changes or revisions to these rates generally require the same procedure of public hearing and notice as the original establishment, except when such changes are made on a pro rata basis across all classes, in which case no further hearing or notice is necessary.
