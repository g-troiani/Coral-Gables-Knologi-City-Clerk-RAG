Later, the Arcadian fixture was selected around 1980 as the standard Coral Gables Light Fixture, reflecting efforts to maintain a consistent urban aesthetic. Additionally, the Fink Light, used at important locations like the Douglas Entrance, and the Transit Line Fixture, associated with the trolley system and installed on Miracle Mile after World War II, illustrate the diversity and evolution of streetlight types in the city.
