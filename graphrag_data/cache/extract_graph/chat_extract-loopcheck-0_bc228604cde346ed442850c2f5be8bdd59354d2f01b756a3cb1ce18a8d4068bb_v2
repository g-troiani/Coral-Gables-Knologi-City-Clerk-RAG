The request that we are making today is to demolish an existing building that sits at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia and replace it with another building.   The idea is -- well, the reason for it is the building was old, had sagging floors and had a lot of issues and it made more sense to demolish the building and build a new one.   The new structure will be approximately the same size.   It will house the same two classrooms,  Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, a multi-purpose room and storage area.  The difference in the square footage is that there is now a covered walkway that is a canopy and it's an awning and that,  for security purposes,  will be enclosed and it will connect to another building on the campus.   Let' s see,  the Board of Architects has approved the new building. We went twice to the Board of Architects.   They wanted windows on the eastern side of the new building.   One of the conditions that was imposed in the 2001-2003 master plan would be that no building would have any windows on the eastern side.  Board of Architects insisted that it would look too institutional,  which is what we were trying to avoid,  and so they asked that we change that condition and the windows are fixed and operable windows.   They' re meant for an aesthetic purpose,  not to function.   They are actually on the portion of the building that' s closest to the front, which is adjacent to the driveway and garage of the adjacent neighbor to the east of us.   The balance of the building,  which is in back,  which would face the single- family neighbor to the right is solid and there' s extensive landscaping that' s several feet wide that was put in back in 2003 as part of the condition for the original site plan. We appeared before the Planning and Zoning Board. Staff recommended approval with three conditions,  that the windows remain fixed and inoperative,  that we keep every other condition,  including the limitation on the number of children,  and that we heavily landscape the front part of this building.  During COVID, the front part of this building was graveled in order to facilitate the drop-off when we first started going back to school.  And so it has remained gravel. That gravel will be removed after construction and that area in front of this will be heavily landscaped.   So, right now the drop-off is set up.  There is a drop-off for the older grades.   Third, fourth,  and fifth grade are dropped off in front of the school.   Four parking spaces are coned off and the parents come in going east to west so that the children can be dropped off on the sidewalk side and not on the street side.   And a neighbor that -who is here as well has appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and an additional condition was added to the approval. And the condition was that the church landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia. And so we' re here to respectfully request that we keep the conditions that were imposed by staff and eliminate that condition and I'd like to explain why.   First of all, those are not adjacent neighbors.   Those four properties,  one of them happens to belong to the church,  the one on the corner of --  the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova belongs to St. Philip' s. The other three are not adjacent, meaning they don' t abut the school property. We are not proposing an increase in students,  so we are not making a bigger impact.   The same number of students,  180, have gone to this school since 2001.  We are in an area where the increased activity and need for parking has come from the beautiful playground equipment that now adorns\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nSalvadore Park.   Having used it as a mother,  it's a vast improvement from what it was 30-some years ago.   There is also,  as you know, very active use of the tennis courts,  starting from early in the morning now that one of the courts has been designated a pickleball court,  one of the most popular sports in in the country.   And you also now have a dog park.  So, it is a neighborhood that has a lot of activity.   The school is there 172 days out of 365.   Yes,  the church does have its activities,  but I would submit to you that the school is not the only reason why there' s an issue with parking.   And I think it' s not fair to penalize the nonprofit school and institution that lives there,  but rather we should try to work as a community,  both the City and the church and school, to see if we can find a way to alleviate the parking on swales.   I brought --  because I want you to know the school tries very hard to make sure that parents don' t park in the swale.   That doesn' t mean they don' t, but they try very hard.   And I just brought two samples of newsletters.   So, this newsletter is published monthly,  and it goes out to all the school parents,  and I highlighted -there' s a whole section on parking.   I'm going to pass these around.   So,  it's not something that they say once at the beginning of the school year during orientation and just\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Salvadore Park<|>project<|>Salvadore Park, a neighborhood park featuring a playground section, tennis courts, a pickleball court, a small parking lot to the east, and a dog park, located immediately south of the school property.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>School Building<|>project<|>The existing school building located at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia, which is old with sagging floors and issues, proposed to be demolished and replaced with a new building of approximately the same size housing two classrooms (Pre-K 3 and Pre-K 4), a multi-purpose room, and storage area, including a covered walkway to be enclosed for security and connecting to another building on campus.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Board of Architects<|>organization<|>The Board of Architects, which has approved the new school building design after two reviews, insisted on windows on the eastern side of the building for aesthetic purposes, overriding a condition from the 2001-2003 master plan that prohibited windows on that side to avoid an institutional look.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>2001-2003 Master Plan<|>document_number<|>The 2001-2003 master plan that included a condition prohibiting windows on the eastern side of the school building, a condition later challenged by the Board of Architects to allow fixed and operable windows for aesthetic reasons.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Planning and Zoning Board<|>organization<|>The Planning and Zoning Board, before which the school project appeared, recommended approval with three conditions: windows remain fixed and inoperative, all other conditions including limitation on number of children remain, and heavy landscaping of the front part of the building.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>School<|>organization<|>The school located immediately north of Salvadore Park, operating 172 days a year with 180 students since 2001, maintaining efforts to prevent parking on swales, and requesting to keep staff-imposed conditions while eliminating a condition requiring the church to landscape and maintain swales from Coral Way to Andalusia.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Church<|>organization<|>The church owning one of the four properties from Coral Way to Andalusia, specifically the one on the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova (St. Philip's), involved in a condition to landscape and maintain swales, which the school requests to eliminate.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Swales<|>project<|>The swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia, which were subject to a landscaping and maintenance condition imposed on the church and other property owners as part of the Planning and Zoning Board approval.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Newsletter<|>document_number<|>A monthly newsletter published by the school and distributed to all school parents, containing a section on parking to encourage parents not to park on swales.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>School Building<|>Board of Architects<|>The Board of Architects approved the new school building design after two reviews and required windows on the eastern side for aesthetic purposes, overriding a prior master plan condition.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Board of Architects<|>2001-2003 Master Plan<|>The Board of Architects challenged and modified a condition from the 2001-2003 master plan that prohibited windows on the eastern side of the building.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>School Building<|>Planning and Zoning Board<|>The school building project appeared before the Planning and Zoning Board, which recommended approval with three conditions related to windows, landscaping, and limitation on number of children.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>School<|>Swales<|>The school requests to eliminate the condition requiring the church to landscape and maintain the swales, arguing the properties are not adjacent neighbors and the school maintains efforts to prevent parking on swales.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Church<|>Swales<|>The church owns one of the four properties subject to the landscaping and maintenance condition on the swales from Coral Way to Andalusia.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>School<|>Newsletter<|>The school publishes a monthly newsletter to all parents, including a section on parking to discourage parking on swales.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>School<|>Church<|>The school and church are part of the community effort to address parking issues on swales, with the school requesting cooperation rather than penalization.<|>6)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
