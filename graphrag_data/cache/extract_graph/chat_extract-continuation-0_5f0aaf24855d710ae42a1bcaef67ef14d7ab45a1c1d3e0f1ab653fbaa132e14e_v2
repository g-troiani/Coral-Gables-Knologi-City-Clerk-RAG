I know Mr. Trowbridge also told me he wanted a little more time to have conversations with the members. So, always willing to listen to what our business community' s needs are.\n\nMs. Hernandez:   Thank you, Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And thank you, Mr. Chamizo and Mr. Adams for being here as well. And the members who actually --  who sent emails.\n\nMr. Chamizo:  One final item,  Manny Chamizo,  once again. Echoing Commissioner -Kirk' s comment,  there are a number of signs that are currently out of compliance. I can tell you,  I've been here 41 years, I'm sure you' ve been here just as long.  Neon signs, you know that neon signs are not supposed to be on the windows.   They' re there.   I mean,  I see them.   They' re supposed to be, I believe, you can correct me if I'm wrong, I believe it has to be six feet from the actual window. You can have neon, just can' t have it up in windows.   There are hundreds of violations.   So, that' s why I'm kind of like, hey man, what happened?   You know, why are we --?   Are we going to go out there now, we' re going to go with, you know, an actual measuring stick and start measuring if we are two inches above or one quarter of an inch, because there' s so many violations.   So, I think that the first thing,  if you want to start cracking down on signs,  start cracking down on all signs. And then we can start focusing in on the commercial real estate signs,  which may or may not be in compliance.   Thank you again.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I mean,  well,  I appreciate that.   And I think that Code Enforcement should do a better job of enforcing.   I think that the conversation here is specifically about the real estate signs and I think the focus of what Commissioner Menendez was saying was about the real estate signs.   So, that being said,  I guess I'll defer the item.\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay, thank you.  Moving on to -- thank you for being here.   I appreciate it.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a city official participating in the meeting and discussion regarding code enforcement and real estate signs compliance.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Ms. Hernandez, city staff member involved in the meeting and conversation about code enforcement and scheduling.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>TROWBRIDGE<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Trowbridge, city staff or official mentioned as wanting more time to have conversations with business community members.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAMIZO<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Manny Chamizo, citizen or official with 41 years of experience, speaking about sign code violations and enforcement concerns.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAMS<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Adams, participant in the meeting acknowledged by Commissioner Fernandez.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIRK<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Kirk, referenced by Mr. Chamizo in support of comments about sign compliance.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENEDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, referenced by Commissioner Fernandez regarding focus on real estate signs enforcement.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the meeting and moving the agenda forward.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CODE_ENFORCEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City Code Enforcement department responsible for enforcing sign regulations and compliance.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>REAL_ESTATE_SIGNS<|>PROJECT<|>Project or focus area concerning enforcement and compliance of real estate signs in the city.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where discussions about code enforcement and real estate signs took place.)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
