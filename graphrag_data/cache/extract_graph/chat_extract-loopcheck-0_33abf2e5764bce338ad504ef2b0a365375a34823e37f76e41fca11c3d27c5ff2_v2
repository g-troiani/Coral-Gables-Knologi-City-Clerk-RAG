Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

There are those on the County Commission and in Tallahassee who are looking to maybe expand even further out west and further southwest,  but it is something that they are currently working on, and they look like they' d be able to get something done in the next couple of years.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Interesting.  My husband worked for the Mover,  that' s basically a bus on top of a platform,  its rubber tires.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  That' s why I'm saying that' s a really long route for them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It is, and I guess that' s the way that they decided to move.  My dad actually was a quality assurance engineer for the Metro Mover for many years.  He worked with our ACM when he was there in transit.  It's definitely not Metro Rail. You can fit a lot less people, but it does have the ability to move a little bit quicker.   That' s the way that it has been explained to me. They' ll have more of them on the route and it's also cheaper to get the actual cars versus the rail cars.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  when I was on the TPO before the city was removed,  because of the census,  I knew that we were doing a people mover to Miami Beach.  I'm going to look up to see,  I'm going\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nto ask our representative,  the Director of the TPO to send me information because I know that they are trying to figure out ways to do it that is more affordable and they think the people mover could be an opportunity to save money,  but if they can get it out to FIU, trust me, it's a gamechanger. So, I want to - I'm going to call our director there and see if she can send us more info. Mr. Clerk anything else,  any other.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Alright.
