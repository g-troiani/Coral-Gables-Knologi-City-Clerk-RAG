By the way,  thank you for being here and reviewing the proposal.  I appreciate that.  I know you' ve got a lot on your plate and that was sent to you late. I thought it was sent to you before.  I would have removed it off the agenda if we weren' t ready for it, my fault. I apologize.  I know you guys rushed it to take a look at that. So, moving onto item F2. You want to just kind of put Pittman Park to rest.  I think we have a graph there,  not a graph, excuse me, a diagram.  We can show Pittman Park, something that I would love one day to be able to embark on,  but I'm just a little bit concerned about whether it' s even viable.  Due to several different things that are kind of in conflict;  number one, the neighboring building,  the alley, trying to close that street and connect the park.  Is there anybody from staff that can show this? Do we have anybody from staff?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  the Public Works Director is - he' s coming up now. I'm sure he' s coming up from the conference room.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. We' ll come back to it.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  He' s right here.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  He' s running up the stairs.\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. Caught you off guard there.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Catch your breath.\n\nMayor Lago:  I gave a preamble that this is not a -  this is a beautiful project,  if we can get it to work, but its not really going to work.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: My apologies.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Its okay. We' re just trying to make sure you get your steps in.\n\nLaughter]\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Yes. Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  Mr. Director,  I was explaining that Pittman,  the idea of bringing Pittman Park into Giralda is a beautiful thing, along with the surface parking lot, but there are many conflicts.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Correct.\n\nMayor Lago: The building, the alley, and it just kind of makes the idea and concept a little difficult.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Public Works Director Diaz: So just a little back story.  The current plan, which is not funded due to cost,  its some improvements to the parking lot behind the Giralda Plaza to match the existing pattern,  right. There are also to be some electrical improvements that will allow that park to on an event put some bollards close off the parking lot. I think it's some upgrade electrical so you could potentially put some, maybe some musical equipment,  that' s the original plan. This plan has been completed;  it's done.  The current estimated -  the last estimate that we have for this, which goes back to March of 2023 was $ 940,000,  so obviously, we haven' t been able to fund this.  So subsequently,  there was a discussion about the potential of joining Pittman Park with the parking lot and obviously there' s, like the Mayor mentioned,  there' s a number of conflicts,  especially you do have an alley,  which we need to make sure that we maintain access to, and the building next door has several entrances and exits that need to be maintained.  So, in a kind of general form, you know, there' s a potential to close the space in between,  as you can see on the picture, on the image, while still maintaining access to the property and to the park.  Obviously,  at some point,  if this is something that moves forward,  the county is going to have to get involved,  the county has to allow for the street to be closed.  There' s the potential for some of the signals that may need to be adjusted. If this is something that the Commission desires to move forward with, you know,  we will need about $35,000 for a conceptual layout and $45,000 for a traffic study, just so that we can, obviously\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nthis is a very crude,  we can get some professionals to really tell us what this could be,  and also start having the conversation with the county as to whether they even consider allowing us to do this, right. So, what we need right now is direction from the Commission whether this is something that you would like us to proceed with and obviously we would need the funding so we can start the process.\n\nMayor Lago:  So again,  right now I don' t think it's feasible in regard to funding.  I think this is a great project to do something spectacular,  especially in\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITEM F-2<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda Item F-2, discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning an update regarding Pittman Park and its potential development and connectivity issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PITTMAN PARK<|>PROJECT<|>Pittman Park, a proposed park project discussed for potential connection to Giralda Plaza and improvements including parking lot upgrades and electrical enhancements, currently unfunded and facing logistical challenges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, at City Commission Chambers, 405 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, FL, where Item F-2 was discussed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCE LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Vince Lago, presiding officer of the City of Coral Gables City Commission, sponsor of Agenda Item F-2, who introduced and led the discussion on Pittman Park)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHONDA ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission present at the meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELISSA CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Melissa Castro, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission present at the meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARIEL FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission present at the meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIRK MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Kirk Menendez, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission present at the meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISTINA SUÁREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Cristina Suárez, legal advisor to the City of Coral Gables City Commission)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias, city staff member who facilitated the discussion and introduced Public Works Director during the meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLY URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Billy Urquia, city staff member responsible for official records and documentation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMES DIAZ<|>PERSON<|>Public Works Director Hermes Diaz, city staff member who provided detailed information about the Pittman Park project, its challenges, cost estimates, and next steps)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission, the governing body conducting the meeting and decision-making on local projects including Pittman Park)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARKING LOT IMPROVEMENTS<|>PROJECT<|>Proposed improvements to the parking lot behind Giralda Plaza including matching existing patterns and electrical upgrades to support events, part of the overall Pittman Park project plan, estimated cost $940,000 as of March 2023, currently unfunded)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUNDING REQUEST<|>MONEY<|>Estimated funding needed for conceptual layout ($35,000) and traffic study ($45,000) to advance the Pittman Park project feasibility and discussions with the county)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITEM F-2<|>PITTMAN PARK<|>Agenda Item F-2 concerns the update and discussion about the Pittman Park project<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCE LAGO<|>ITEM F-2<|>Mayor Vince Lago sponsored and led the discussion on Agenda Item F-2<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMES DIAZ<|>PITTMAN PARK<|>Public Works Director Hermes Diaz provided detailed information and updates about the Pittman Park project<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>ITEM F-2<|>The City of Coral Gables City Commission held the meeting where Agenda Item F-2 was discussed<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER IGLESIAS<|>HERMES DIAZ<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias introduced Public Works Director Hermes Diaz during the meeting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PITTMAN PARK<|>PARKING LOT IMPROVEMENTS<|>Parking lot improvements are part of the overall Pittman Park project plan<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PITTMAN PARK<|>FUNDING REQUEST<|>Funding request is necessary to proceed with conceptual layout and traffic study for Pittman Park project feasibility<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCE LAGO<|>PITTMAN PARK<|>Mayor Lago expressed support and concerns about the viability and funding of the Pittman Park project<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
