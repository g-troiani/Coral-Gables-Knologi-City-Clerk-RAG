I think maybe something that would help sort of give some reference is actually a local precedent that we have in Miami-Dade County, there' s something called the Urban Center Program;  and within the Urban Center Program sort of very similar along the lines of trying to give parking discounts for workforce housing along transit,  they basically -  I'm happy to share it with the Clerk and maybe he can distribute it to you all. They have a tiered system which basically gives a by-right workforce reduction of 25 percent and then when you are building within 500 feet of a rail station,  you can actually qualify for up to 100 percent reduction and then it goes in terms of, and then it reduces based on how far you are from a bus stop, etc., goes all the way to ten percent reduction.  And then the way that they do it in terms of parcel size is that parcels less than 15,000 square feet get up to 100 percent reduction,  and then parcel size between 15 to 30,000 feet get a 60 percent reduction; parcels greater than 30,000 get a 20 percent parking reduction.  And that' s kind of the way they do it. It' s just an idea.  I understand that this is a new sort of program that we have to, I think the Commission is obligated to at least try to make some kind of accommodation for parking,  but I think this is a reference that could sort of help guide the conversation.  And I just wanted to share it with you all. Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Aky, thank you. I've had the pleasure meeting with Mr. Fernandez,  a very bright, young architect who has an interesting vision and take on potentially offering affordability in this community,  and he' s doing some interesting projects,  not only locally,  but throughout South Florida.  One of the big issues that we have to find a balance for, and this is something that I' ve\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ntalked to with Mr. Fernandez,  we' ve met on several occasions,  is the issue of finding that balance when you' re reducing parking.  One of the issues that we face today,  as you saw with the school, was,  if you reduce parking and we really don' t have a sufficient transit system,  that' s why years ago, and I lost on this. I advocated and the Commission supported me on a resolution to have actual rail on the south corridor and not to do BRT,  because I knew that the hundreds of millions of dollars that we' re spending on BRT, we're going to fall short on really delivering on worldclass transportation. Now we're seeing that already.  To really be able to provide massive parking reductions like other cities have done, for example,  New York, which some buildings don' t even have parking,  you really have to have a robust transportation system that really delivers on moving people.  Our bus system is not where it should be, number one,  and people are not going to ride, excuse me, not going to ride two or three or four modalities to get to work. What are the modalities? the bus, the people- mover,  the BRT, and then Metrorail.  In certain cases,  people are riding four modalities to get to work, two or three hours to get to work. They are just going to stick with their car.  So,  if we do significant parking reductions,  which again,  I think we need to do in the future, if we' re really going to be able to address the issue of affordability in our community,  especially for teachers,  police, fire, first responders,  the issue has to be where can we deliver on transportation so that people really,  really don' t need to use vehicles.  So,  he has an interesting concept that he showed me which I recommend that you show it to the other Commissioners that deals with Ponce, facing the Metrorail and it would be something interesting if that Metrorail connected to something for example,  Homestead,  FIU, Miami-Dade College,  Miami Beach,  where people could actually ride transportation and use one modality all the way from work and home. I recommend that you meet with him. Pretty sharp guy.\n\nVice Mayor Lago:  So,  I'm going to dovetail what you said,  because I was down there as well pushing for the rail and more recently you know when I had meetings with our state representatives I said, don' t do what California did and we' re going to end up with urban sprawl and no transportation because people will have to have a car to get somewhere.  If you want to have affordable living, you also have to have affordable transportation.  We always expect these transit services to turn a profit and it's just not realistic.  We always have money for asphalt.  We don' t have enough money for putting in rail and some of the feedback I got was, Tallahassee can' t put money into the rail. We' re really dependent upon the TPO and for the county to fund that program and get it to half, because it needs to go where people need to go. You need to go out to FIU, you need to get to the colleges,  you need to get effectively get to the airport,  because our airport rail is not like the one in Atlanta, New York, DC, where you can walk right out from getting your baggage and hop right on. You haven' t taken it, it's eye-opening to take it. It would be very, very patently obvious to you that it's inadequate in our\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Urban Center Program<|>project<|>The Urban Center Program in Miami-Dade County, a local precedent referenced for providing parking discounts for workforce housing along transit, featuring a tiered system of parking reductions based on proximity to rail stations, bus stops, and parcel size.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>person<|>Mayor Lago, a City of Coral Gables official who discussed meeting with Mr. Fernandez and the challenges of balancing parking reductions with transportation infrastructure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mr. Fernandez<|>person<|>Mr. Fernandez, a young architect with a vision for affordability in the community, involved in interesting projects locally and throughout South Florida, who has met several times with Mayor Lago to discuss parking and transportation issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>meeting<|>City Commission Meeting where discussions about parking reductions, transportation challenges, and affordability took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Lago<|>person<|>Vice Mayor Lago, a City of Coral Gables official advocating for rail transit funding and affordable transportation to support affordable living, emphasizing the need for robust transit systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRT<|>project<|>Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a transportation system discussed as insufficient compared to rail, with concerns about its effectiveness in delivering world-class transportation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Metrorail<|>project<|>Metrorail, a rail transit system referenced as a key modality for transportation, with suggestions to connect it to locations such as Homestead, FIU, Miami-Dade College, and Miami Beach to improve transit accessibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Rail on the South Corridor Resolution<|>resolution<|>A resolution supported by Mayor Lago and the City Commission advocating for actual rail on the south corridor instead of BRT, aiming to improve transportation infrastructure.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Urban Center Program<|>BRT<|>The Urban Center Program is referenced as a local precedent for parking discounts along transit, similar in intent to the transportation discussions involving BRT.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Mr. Fernandez<|>Mayor Lago has met several times with Mr. Fernandez to discuss balancing parking reductions and transportation issues.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Rail on the South Corridor Resolution<|>Mayor Lago advocated for and the Commission supported a resolution for rail on the south corridor instead of BRT.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Lago<|>Rail on the South Corridor Resolution<|>Vice Mayor Lago supports rail transit funding and opposes reliance on BRT, aligning with the resolution for rail on the south corridor.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Metrorail<|>Mayor Lago discussed the importance of Metrorail connectivity to key locations to improve transportation and reduce parking needs.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mr. Fernandez<|>Metrorail<|>Mr. Fernandez proposed a concept involving Ponce facing the Metrorail, suggesting improved connectivity to various locations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Lago<|>BRT<|>Vice Mayor Lago criticized BRT as insufficient and advocated for rail transit funding instead.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Mayor Lago<|>Mayor Lago spoke at the City Commission Meeting about transportation and parking issues.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Vice Mayor Lago<|>Vice Mayor Lago spoke at the City Commission Meeting about transportation funding and affordable living.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
