It collaborates closely with other city boards and external entities such as the Florida Power and Light Company to standardize, install, and maintain streetlight fixtures throughout the city, ensuring consistent and efficient lighting infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to its role in streetlight management, the Public Works Department oversees compliance with requirements related to above-ground appurtenances connected to underground utility lines, ensuring that all installations meet city standards and regulations. The department also plays a critical role in the approval and management of roadway relocations, including ingress and egress points, to prevent traffic obstructions and maintain smooth traffic flow within the city.\n\nThe department is responsible for the administrative processing of various applications related to city development and infrastructure projects. This includes preparing application forms, receiving and reviewing submissions from property owners, investigating proposed plans, and making recommendations to the City Commission. It issues construction permits based on these reviews and ensures that all procedures comply with relevant city codes and regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the Public Works Department manages the receipt and processing of fees associated with these applications, providing receipts to applicants and setting dates for review by the Development Review Committee. It forwards applications to the committee after completing initial reviews, facilitating a structured and transparent review process. Specifically, the department handles Class 1 permit applications from upland owners, reviewing all submitted forms, plans, and certifications in accordance with Section 109-41 of the city code.\n\nOverall, the Public Works Department serves as a central administrative and regulatory body within the City of Coral Gables, ensuring that infrastructure projects, streetlight installations, and development applications are thoroughly reviewed, approved, and implemented in a manner that supports the city’s operational standards and community needs.\",13\n134,23-6674,\"Document number 23-6674, associated with the Planning and Zoning Board Meeting of November 8, 2023.\",1\n461,OWNER,\"The owner is the individual who holds ownership of upland property adjacent to proposed structures or work.

It includes a covered walkway canopy that will be enclosed for security and connect to another campus building. The Board of Architects approved the design after requiring windows on the eastern side, which were previously prohibited by a 2001-2003 master plan condition. The windows are fixed and operable for aesthetic purposes only. Landscaping will be heavily applied to the front after construction, and gravel used during COVID for drop-off will be removed.\",9\n600,BOARD OF ARCHITECTS,\"The Board of Architects is an advisory and regulatory body operating in Coral Gables, actively collaborating with the City of Coral Gables, the Historic Preservation Board, and other entities to ensure architectural integrity and standardization in the community. One of its key roles includes working to standardize streetlight fixtures throughout Coral Gables, contributing to the city’s cohesive aesthetic and historic preservation efforts.\n\nIn addition to its advisory functions, the Board of Architects plays a critical role in the review and approval of development projects within Coral Gables. This includes participation in public hearing processes, where it ensures compliance with specific procedural requirements such as timely notice publication before hearings. The Board is also responsible for approving building demolitions and development plans, particularly those subject to restrictive covenants, as exemplified by its involvement in projects like St. Philip’s School.\n\nThe Board of Architects notably reviewed and approved the design for a new preschool building at St. Philip’s School. This approval process was thorough, involving multiple reviews, including Development Review Committee (DRC) and neighborhood meetings, with formal approvals granted in April and August prior to the City Commission meeting. During this process, the Board required specific design modifications to maintain the building’s aesthetic quality and avoid an institutional appearance. Notably, it mandated the inclusion of both fixed and operable windows on the eastern side of the new building, a decision that overrode a previous condition from the 2001-2003 master plan which had prohibited windows on that side.
