The City Attorney plays a pivotal role by serving complaints, publishing notices, and managing procedural compliance. The forfeiture process is formalized through complaints filed in court, notices published in newspapers, and judicial hearings. Properties involved are often not listed on common real estate platforms, indicating a unique subset of real estate subject to municipal enforcement actions.\",\n  \"rating\": 7.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is elevated due to the legal and financial implications of forfeiture proceedings on property owners and the city’s enforcement capabilities.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Central role of the City Attorney in forfeiture proceedings\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The City Attorney is the primary legal representative managing forfeiture actions on behalf of the city. This entity is responsible for serving forfeiture complaints as original service of process to interested parties, ensuring that legal procedures are properly initiated. Additionally, the City Attorney publishes forfeiture complaint notices in newspapers of general circulation once each week for two consecutive weeks, fulfilling statutory publication requirements. The City Attorney also receives responsive pleadings and affirmative defenses from claimants, positioning this role as the procedural and legal hub of the forfeiture process.

It must comply with strict legal requirements, including jurisdictional statements, detailed factual bases for forfeiture, verified affidavits, and explicit descriptions of the property subject to forfeiture. The complaint also specifies the county, place, and date of seizure, as well as the city and court where the case is filed. This comprehensive documentation ensures that forfeiture actions are grounded in a legally sufficient framework, providing transparency and due process.

These properties may feature signage not listed on common platforms such as MLS or LoopNet, indicating a subset of real estate that is less visible in the open market. Properties under forfeiture are subject to legal actions including liens to cover city-incurred costs for work performed. This highlights the financial and legal stakes involved for property owners and the city, as these properties are both physical assets and legal subjects of enforcement actions [Data: Entities (126); Relationships (1544, 1545, 168)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Limited engagement with common real estate listing services\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The community’s properties often lack presence on widely used real estate listing platforms such as LoopNet and MLS. Mayor Lago’s observations indicate that many property sellers do not use or pay for MLS listings, and some properties are not listed on LoopNet.
