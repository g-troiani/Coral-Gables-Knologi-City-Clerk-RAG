Additionally, the resolution asks the City Commission to formally adopt the recommended standard streetlight. It is also noted that Agenda Item 2-1 includes a presentation of draft or final minutes from Boards and/or Committees requesting action from the City Commission, with the clarification that a vote to accept these minutes does not imply approval of the content within them.
