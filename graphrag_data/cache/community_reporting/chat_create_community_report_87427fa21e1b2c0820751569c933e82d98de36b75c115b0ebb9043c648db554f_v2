It mandates that all utility lines, including electrical power distribution, telephone, communication, street lighting, and video service cables, must be installed underground, with exceptions for transmission lines and city-installed utility lines and poles. The section aims to enhance reliability, public safety, aesthetics, and continuity of service by promoting the conversion of overhead facilities to underground systems. This regulation applies broadly to new construction, rehabilitation projects exceeding 50% of replacement value, and conversion projects, ensuring a consistent approach to utility infrastructure modernization. The city code also includes provisions for administrative review, enforcement, and penalties for noncompliance, making it a cornerstone of the community's operational and legal environment [Data: Entities (46, 139, 162, 141, 167); Relationships (188, 193, 235, 236)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Defined roles and responsibilities of Pole Owners and Attaching Entities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Pole Owners and Attaching Entities have clearly delineated responsibilities under the undergrounding project.

Attaching Entities, which attach facilities or equipment to utility poles, are required to underground their facilities or remove attachments from redundant poles in coordination with Pole Owners. Failure by Attaching Entities to comply results in code enforcement violations and accruing fines. Additionally, Attaching Entities must make payments to the city for continued use of private easements or city property when poles are conveyed or transferred.

City-installed utility lines and poles, including city-owned network infrastructure, are exempt from Section 78-281 provisions. Transmission lines, defined as wires and conductors exclusively for electrical energy transmission between generating stations and substations, are also exempt. Additionally, major hardening projects governed by Florida Statute § 366.97 have specific procedures and may supersede conflicting city procedures. The Florida Public Service Commission oversees these projects and issues orders that control in case of conflict with city regulations. These exemptions and special cases introduce complexity into the regulatory environment and require coordination between city and state authorities [Data: Entities (162, 161, 176, 177, 181); Relationships (193, 231, 232, 233)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Enforcement mechanisms include permit denial and escalating fines\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The community enforces compliance through a combination of permit denial and financial penalties. Pole Owners and Attaching Entities who fail to remove redundant poles or pole attachments face code enforcement violations under Section 101-137 of the City Code. Violations result in fines accruing daily on a per-pole basis until compliance is achieved. Furthermore, noncompliance can lead to denial of future permits, effectively restricting the ability of entities to operate or expand utility infrastructure.
