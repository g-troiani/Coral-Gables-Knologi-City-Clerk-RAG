In November, the board recommended approval of a major amendment to the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School, including the proposed preschool building. Their approval came with several conditions: windows on the new building were to remain fixed and inoperative, all previous conditions such as limits on student numbers were to be maintained, and heavy landscaping was required at the front of the building. Additionally, the board mandated that the church associated with the school landscape and maintain the swales on properties along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia, and they requested an expansion of these swale improvements in that area.\n\nThe board’s responsibilities extend beyond site plan approvals; it considers applications as part of the site plan review and approval process, thoroughly reviews the entire record after public hearings in accordance with the zoning code and specific municipal sections (62-328 and 62-330), and forwards its recommendations to the City Commission for final decisions. The Planning and Zoning Board also serves as a body to which City staff report during the Zoning in Progress Resolution process, receiving updates and recommendations related to zoning matters and moratoriums.\n\nMoreover, the board addresses neighborhood concerns related to traffic, property maintenance, parking, and landscaping, often directing improvements such as swale enhancements to mitigate environmental and community impacts. Through these functions, the Planning and Zoning Board acts as a critical intermediary between the public, city staff, and the City Commission, ensuring that development projects comply with zoning regulations while balancing neighborhood interests and environmental considerations.\",13\n522,SWALES,\"The swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia, which the church was required to landscape and maintain as an additional condition imposed by the Planning and Zoning Board.\",2\n421,BOARD OF ARCHITECTS,\"The Board of Architects is a professional advisory body operating in Coral Gables, actively involved in maintaining architectural integrity and standardizing design elements within the city. It collaborates closely with the City of Coral Gables, the Historic Preservation Board, and other entities to ensure cohesive urban development, including efforts to standardize streetlight fixtures throughout the city. The Board plays a significant role in the review and approval process for development projects, including those influenced by local regulations such as the Live Local Act.\n\nA notable example of the Board’s work is its involvement in the design and approval of the new preschool building for St. Philip's School. The Board conducted multiple reviews of the proposed building design, including consultations with the Design Review Committee (DRC) and neighborhood meetings, before granting approval in April and again in August. During this process, the Board required specific architectural modifications to enhance the building’s aesthetic appeal and maintain the community’s character. One key requirement was the inclusion of windows on the eastern side of the building, a change that overrode a previous condition from the 2001-2003 master plan, which had prohibited windows on that side. The Board insisted on a combination of fixed and operable windows to avoid an institutional appearance and to improve the building’s overall design quality.\n\nThrough its advisory and regulatory functions, the Board of Architects ensures that new developments in Coral Gables align with established architectural standards and community expectations, balancing historical preservation with contemporary needs.\",8\n420,NEW BUILDING,\"A new building proposed to replace an old building at the southeast corner of St. Philip's property on Andalusia. The new structure will be approximately the same size, housing two classrooms (Pre-K 3 and Pre-K 4), a multi-purpose room, and storage area. It includes a covered walkway canopy that will be enclosed for security and connect to another campus building. The Board of Architects approved the design after requiring windows on the eastern side, which were previously prohibited by a 2001-2003 master plan condition. The windows are fixed and operable for aesthetic purposes only.
