The same number of students,  180, have gone to this school since 2001.  We are in an area where the increased activity and need for parking has come from the beautiful playground equipment that now adorns\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nSalvadore Park.   Having used it as a mother,  it's a vast improvement from what it was 30-some years ago.   There is also,  as you know, very active use of the tennis courts,  starting from early in the morning now that one of the courts has been designated a pickleball court,  one of the most popular sports in in the country.   And you also now have a dog park.  So, it is a neighborhood that has a lot of activity.   The school is there 172 days out of 365.   Yes,  the church does have its activities,  but I would submit to you that the school is not the only reason why there' s an issue with parking.   And I think it' s not fair to penalize the nonprofit school and institution that lives there,  but rather we should try to work as a community,  both the City and the church and school, to see if we can find a way to alleviate the parking on swales.   I brought --  because I want you to know the school tries very hard to make sure that parents don' t park in the swale.   That doesn' t mean they don' t, but they try very hard.   And I just brought two samples of newsletters.   So, this newsletter is published monthly,  and it goes out to all the school parents,  and I highlighted -there' s a whole section on parking.   I'm going to pass these around.   So,  it's not something that they say once at the beginning of the school year during orientation and just say,  okay,  we hope you guys pay attention to it.  No, they' re reminded on a regular basis,  and I can tell you that the Ed Diaz,  who' s chief of operations,  has been called by nearby residents to ask parents to,  you know,  leave the driveway or whatever. So,  we' re well aware of it and we try working hard to prevent it from happening.   But I think the burden of landscaping and maintaining non-adjacent neighbors is just -seems more like a penalty to a school. If I were asking for an increase in students,  I would say,  yeah,  of course,  because we' re going to now have a bigger impact on the community.   We' re bringing more cars to the area with more students.   But we still have the same students,  the same number of students for the last 22 years.   So, let me pass this around.\n\nCommissioner Castro: Since this is a quasi- judicial item,  I would like to disclose that I have received emails regarding this item.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I've received emails as well.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Same here, so have I.\n\nMayor Lago:   I think everybody has,  so moving on.\n\nMs. Russo:  Alright,  so I respectfully request that you approve the proposal for the new building along with the staff-imposed conditions and eliminate the condition of landscaping the properties between Coral Way and Andalusia on Cordova.  And we' re here to answer any questions you may have, and I would like to reserve some time for rebuttal,  if necessary.\n\nMayor Lago:   Madam Director,  how are you?\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Good,  thank you.   Good morning,  Jennifer Garcia,  Planning Official.  If I could have the PowerPoint,  please.  Okay,  so we' re here for a major amendment to the approved 2002 site plan for St. Philip' s School.   As indicated,  this site is south of Coral Way to the east of\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nColumbus,  north of Andalusia,  and to just west of Cordova.  This is an aerial of the campus.  We' re talking about just the southeast portion of the campus,  which is now an existing house typology which was converted into a preschool.   So, the future land use designation is religious institutional use.   The zoning is special use.   So,  the Ordinance Number 3576 is what approved the site plan. And then there' s conditions regarding any changes to the site plan would have to require Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission review and approval,  as well as the no openings on the east façade. So,  again,  we' re talking about the southeast portion of the site and looking at the proposed building,  it would have classrooms one and two for preschool on the front, the back-ofhouse equipment is located west of the building away from the single- family adjacent house, restored swale on the front of the structure of the proposed preschool building,  a front yard.   The storage is going to be acting as a buffer between the existing home to the east and the actual preschool area,  and in the back is a multi-purpose room and playground.   Here' s a rendering of what that looks like.  Again,  this was approved by the Board of Architects.   It went to DRC back in April of last year.   Board of Architects,  a couple of times, and approval in August.   They had a neighborhood meeting in October. Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval in November,  and here we are for first reading at City Commission\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Salvadore Park<|>project<|>Salvadore Park, a neighborhood park featuring playground equipment, tennis courts including a designated pickleball court, and a dog park, noted for increased activity and parking needs as of January 9, 2024.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>St. Philip's School<|>organization<|>St. Philip's School, a nonprofit religious institutional use school located on a campus south of Coral Way, east of City Commission Meeting area, north of Andalusia, and west of Cordova, operating since at least 2001 with a stable student population of 180 students.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ed Diaz<|>person<|>Ed Diaz, chief of operations at St. Philip's School, responsible for addressing parking issues by communicating with parents and nearby residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>meeting<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, discussing a major amendment to the approved 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School and related community concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2002 Site Plan<|>document_number<|>The approved 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School, authorized by Ordinance Number 3576, defining land use and zoning conditions including no openings on the east façade and requiring Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission review for changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ordinance 3576<|>ordinance<|>Ordinance Number 3576, which approved the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School, establishing zoning as special use and conditions for site plan changes requiring Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission approval.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Board of Architects<|>organization<|>Board of Architects, a professional body that approved the proposed preschool building design for St. Philip's School, with approvals in April and August prior to the City Commission meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Planning and Zoning Board<|>organization<|>Planning and Zoning Board, a city board that recommended approval of the major amendment to the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School in November prior to the City Commission meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Planner Jennifer Garcia<|>person<|>Jennifer Garcia, City Planner and Planning Official presenting the major amendment to the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School at the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Proposed Preschool Building<|>project<|>Proposed preschool building on the southeast portion of St. Philip's School campus, including classrooms, back-of-house equipment, restored swale, front yard, storage buffer, multi-purpose room, and playground, approved by Board of Architects and Planning and Zoning Board.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>St. Philip's School<|>Ed Diaz<|>Ed Diaz is chief of operations at St. Philip's School and manages parking issues by communicating with parents and residents, as stated in the immediate context.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Jennifer Garcia<|>Jennifer Garcia presented the major amendment to the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2002 Site Plan<|>Ordinance 3576<|>Ordinance Number 3576 approved the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School, establishing zoning and conditions for site plan changes.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Proposed Preschool Building<|>Board of Architects<|>The Board of Architects approved the design of the proposed preschool building for St. Philip's School in April and August prior to the City Commission meeting.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Proposed Preschool Building<|>Planning and Zoning Board<|>Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval of the proposed preschool building amendment to the 2002 site plan in November prior to the City Commission meeting.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Proposed Preschool Building<|>St. Philip's School<|>The proposed preschool building is a major amendment to the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School, located on the southeast portion of its campus.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Proposed Preschool Building<|>The City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, is held to consider the major amendment involving the proposed preschool building at St. Philip's School.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
