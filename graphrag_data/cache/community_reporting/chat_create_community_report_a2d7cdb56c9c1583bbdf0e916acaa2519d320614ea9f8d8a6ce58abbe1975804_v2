The department reviews proposed construction plans, conducts investigations, and makes recommendations to the city commission prior to public hearings on permit applications. Upon approval by the city commission and relevant agencies, the department issues construction permits and ensures compliance with all permit requirements. This oversight includes establishing construction standards, determining appropriate performance bond amounts, requiring bond postings, and supervising engineering certifications throughout the construction process.
