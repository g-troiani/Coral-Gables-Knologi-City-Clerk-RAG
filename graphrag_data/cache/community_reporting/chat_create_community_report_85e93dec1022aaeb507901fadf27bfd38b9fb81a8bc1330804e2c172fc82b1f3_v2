The program also features graduated parking reductions that decrease with distance from bus stops. Additionally, the size of the parcel influences the level of parking reduction: parcels under 15,000 square feet are eligible for up to a 100% reduction, parcels between 15,000 and 30,000 square feet receive a 60% reduction, and parcels over 30,000 square feet qualify for a 20% reduction.
