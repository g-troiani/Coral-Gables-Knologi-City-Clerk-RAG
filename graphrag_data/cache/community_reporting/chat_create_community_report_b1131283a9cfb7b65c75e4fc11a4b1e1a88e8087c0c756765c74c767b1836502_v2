This development pattern leads to significant transportation challenges and increased infrastructure costs, which are critical issues for urban planners and policymakers. The prominence of Urban Sprawl in this community underscores its role as a driver of both environmental and economic impacts in the region.

The commission's opposition to moving the UDB Line reflects concerns that such a change would facilitate further urban sprawl, leading to increased development and higher infrastructure spending.
