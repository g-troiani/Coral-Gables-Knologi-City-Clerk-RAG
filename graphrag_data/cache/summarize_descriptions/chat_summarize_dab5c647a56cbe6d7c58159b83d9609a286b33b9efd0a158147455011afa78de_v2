The notice includes essential details such as the time, place, and a brief description of the proposed action or work to be considered during the hearing. In addition to newspaper publication, the City supplements the notice by mailing courtesy notices to property owners located within a minimum radius of 1,000 feet from the affected property. Furthermore, signs are posted directly on the property involved, clearly indicating the nature of the proposed action and the hearing details.
