( Sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez)\n\nMayor Lago:  F-10.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  F-10 is a Resolution of the City Commission directing the City Clerk and City Manager to schedule bimonthly presentation and protocol ceremonies.\n\nDeputy City Attorney Throckmorton:  Good afternoon again.  I'll just give you a brief overview of the resolution presented to you today,  sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez.  This resolution directs that the City Clerk and City Manager schedule bimonthly morning ceremonies at the Police and Fire Headquarters,  dedicated solely to presentations and protocol documents that section of the agenda.  The exact day and month of the ceremony may be moved occasionally to accommodate\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nstaff and the City Commission and the general public and as time and urgency demand we may still have presentation and protocol documents on our regular City Commission agenda,  as drafted.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  So, I had brought this up early on, I think back in April. We have had a couple of discussions about it. Our Human Resources Department has gone back and done a survey of staff. From the numbers that were presented to me, Police was overwhelmingly in favor of moving the presentation protocols to this format;  Fire was pretty much an even split;  general employees were the ones that were in favor of keeping them here, but as the months have gone on, I think we have seen that we have residents in the room who are here to address items,  members of the community,  the Chamber,  and we continue to have lengthy presentation and protocol,  which I think would benefit from a specific forum where we are properly honoring the individuals or the organizations that are being honored in presentation and protocols,  so I wanted to bring it back and make a motion to move forward with having a specific ceremony to honor these individuals and these organizations that' s not on the Commission meetings so that we can focus our Commission meetings on Commission business.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Mayor,  if I may.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes,  go ahead.  I was going to address it. We just got an interesting email that I wanted to show you. May I Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes, I received it as well. Nadine Aleman who was here this morning.\n\nMayor Lago:  Will you put that up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: ' Good afternoon,  all: This morning, I had the honor of being present at the commission meeting to witness a proud moment: my son, Officer Michael Aleman, receiving an award.  The experience was not just a personal highlight for our family but was made extra special by the setting-a platform where his dedication and accomplishments were recognized before the public eye. The presentation and the heartfelt words spoken during the meeting added an invaluable layer of significance.\n\nIntegrating awards to our police officers into commission meetings amplifies the significance of their achievements within the broader community.  By incorporating these recognitions into such sessions,  we emphasize the importance of law enforcement in our society and showcase the commitment and sacrifices made. This is true for all our first responders and public service members.  This inclusion allows for a broader audience, from community members to local officials, to witness and appreciate the commendable work done.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nConducting these award ceremonies within commission meetings offers a powerful message of support and appreciation for our police force. It underlines the transparency and accountability of our governing bodies,  ensuring that the commendable actions of officers are acknowledged in an open and inclusive environment.  This recognition not only boosts the morale of our officers but also fosters a stronger bond between law enforcement and the community they serve,  promoting a sense of unity and mutual respect.\n\nI want to thank you for setting the stage with your continued support and inclusion of these important recognitions during commission meetings. It is an incredibly meaningful and impactful way to honor their service while fostering a deeper connection between the community and those who serve and protect it.'   I understand your point and we all can do our part on reducing the length of some of our comments,  but I read this into the record to make very,  very clear the feelings of the individuals that were here this morning and if we reflect upon the last Sunshine meeting that we were at regarding proposed change of our zoning code,  I think we had 8 or 9 individuals from the public there. It's a huge difference when you have people here that watch Commission meetings and watch reruns of Commission meetings,  they are unlikely to be watching reruns of a separate meeting at a separate time, because they are interested really in what' s happening here at our Commission every day, what is it that we' re doing.  So, I think that Mrs. Aleman' s comments adequately summarize my viewpoint on this and where I stand on it. I think it' s really important that we honor our first responders\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e20b7f9dce19049a1934d1357e8cfebebeb19b04fe9ad0669ff6c45e287a9b1c_v2"}
