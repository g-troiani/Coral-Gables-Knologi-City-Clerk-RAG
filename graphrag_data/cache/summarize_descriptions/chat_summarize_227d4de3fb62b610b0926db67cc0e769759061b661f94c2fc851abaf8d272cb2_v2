This ordinance amends multiple sections of the City Code, including but not limited to Sections 1-2, 2-464, 2-1091, 18-2, 34-60, 34-239, 58-53, 58-119, 62-329, 62-331, 78-281, 101-109, 109-41, and 109-42. The primary focus of these amendments is to provide a clear definition of \"publication\" and to remove the longstanding requirement for legal notices to be published in newspapers. This change modernizes the City’s procedures for public notices, reflecting evolving communication practices.\n\nIn addition to these amendments related to publication, Agenda Item E-2 also includes a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code by creating Section 5-314 titled \"Window and Hurricane Shutters.\" This new section regulates the closure of window and hurricane shutters, specifically addressing the timing and conditions under which shutters may be closed. Correspondingly, City Code Chapter 1-General Provisions, Section 1-7 \"Penalties,\" was amended to establish penalties for shutter closures outside of the designated hurricane season, ensuring compliance with the new regulations.\n\nThe ordinance includes standard legislative provisions such as a repealer clause, a severability clause, codification instructions, and an effective date to ensure proper implementation and legal clarity. The amendments were sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez and were approved unanimously by the City Commission with a 5-0 vote, including Commissioners Anderson, Castro, Fernandez, Menendez, and Lago. The ordinance was also approved by Mayor Vince Lago and attested by City Clerk Billy Y. Urquia, with legal sufficiency confirmed by City Attorney Cristina M. Suárez. The Planning and Zoning Board reviewed and approved the zoning-related amendments on February 20, 2024, with a 5-0 vote and certain conditions.\n\nOverall, Agenda Item E-2 represents a comprehensive update to the City Code of Coral Gables, streamlining legal notice publication requirements and introducing new regulations for hurricane shutter usage, thereby enhancing both administrative efficiency and community safety.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844107, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 476, "prompt_tokens": 763, "total_tokens": 1239, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
