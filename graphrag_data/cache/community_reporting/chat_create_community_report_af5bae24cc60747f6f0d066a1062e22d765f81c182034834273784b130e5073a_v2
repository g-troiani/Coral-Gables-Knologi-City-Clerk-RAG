The County serves as the overarching jurisdiction within which the city operates and where transportation planning and funding decisions are made. The TPO plays a pivotal role as a funding and planning body, actively supporting transit initiatives including rail and people mover projects. Rail transit is identified as a critical but underfunded infrastructure component, reliant on financial support from both the County and the TPO.

The County's role is critical in enabling and supporting transit initiatives, as it provides necessary funding and regulatory oversight. The relationship between the County and the city underscores the administrative framework within which transportation projects are executed, including the publication of notices and seizure activities related to infrastructure development.
