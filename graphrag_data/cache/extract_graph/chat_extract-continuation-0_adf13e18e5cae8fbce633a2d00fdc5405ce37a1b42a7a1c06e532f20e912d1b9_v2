their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

The idea is -- well, the reason for it is the building was old, had sagging floors and had a lot of issues and it made more sense to demolish the building and build a new one.   The new structure will be approximately the same size.   It will house the same two classrooms,  Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, a multi-purpose room and storage area.  The difference in the square footage is that there is now a covered walkway that is a canopy and it's an awning and that,  for security purposes,  will be enclosed and it will connect to another building on the campus.   Let' s see,  the Board of Architects has approved the new building. We went twice to the Board of Architects.   They wanted windows on the eastern side of the new building.   One of the conditions that was imposed in the 2001-2003 master plan would be that no building would have any windows on the eastern side.  Board of Architects insisted that it would look too institutional,  which is what we were trying to avoid,  and so they asked that we change that condition and the windows are fixed and operable windows.   They' re meant for an aesthetic purpose,  not to function.   They are actually on the portion of the building that' s closest to the front, which is adjacent to the driveway and garage of the adjacent neighbor to the east of us.   The balance of the building,  which is in back,  which would face the single- family neighbor to the right is solid and there' s extensive landscaping that' s several feet wide that was put in back in 2003 as part of the condition for the original site plan. We appeared before the Planning and Zoning Board. Staff recommended approval with three conditions,  that the windows remain fixed and inoperative,  that we keep every other condition,  including the limitation on the number of children,  and that we heavily landscape the front part of this building.  During COVID, the front part of this building was graveled in order to facilitate the drop-off when we first started going back to school.  And so it has remained gravel. That gravel will be removed after construction and that area in front of this will be heavily landscaped.   So, right now the drop-off is set up.  There is a drop-off for the older grades.   Third, fourth,  and fifth grade are dropped off in front of the school.   Four parking spaces are coned off and the parents come in going east to west so that the children can be dropped off on the sidewalk side and not on the street side.   And a neighbor that -who is here as well has appeared at the Planning and Zoning Board and an additional condition was added to the approval. And the condition was that the church landscape and maintain the swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia. And so we' re here to respectfully request that we keep the conditions that were imposed by staff and eliminate that condition and I'd like to explain why.   First of all, those are not adjacent neighbors.   Those four properties,  one of them happens to belong to the church,  the one on the corner of --  the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova belongs to St. Philip' s. The other three are not adjacent, meaning they don' t abut the school property. We are not proposing an increase in students,  so we are not making a bigger impact.   The same number of students,  180, have gone to this school since 2001.  We are in an area where the increased activity and need for parking has come from the beautiful playground equipment that now adorns\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nSalvadore Park.   Having used it as a mother,  it's a vast improvement from what it was 30-some years ago.   There is also,  as you know, very active use of the tennis courts,  starting from early in the morning now that one of the courts has been designated a pickleball court,  one of the most popular sports in in the country.   And you also now have a dog park.  So, it is a neighborhood that has a lot of activity.   The school is there 172 days out of 365.   Yes,  the church does have its activities,  but I would submit to you that the school is not the only reason why there' s an issue with parking.   And I think it' s not fair to penalize the nonprofit school and institution that lives there,  but rather we should try to work as a community,  both the City and the church and school, to see if we can find a way to alleviate the parking on swales.   I brought --  because I want you to know the school tries very hard to make sure that parents don' t park in the swale.   That doesn' t mean they don' t, but they try very hard.   And I just brought two samples of newsletters.   So, this newsletter is published monthly,  and it goes out to all the school parents,  and I highlighted -there' s a whole section on parking.   I'm going to pass these around.   So,  it's not something that they say once at the beginning of the school year during orientation and just say,  okay,  we hope you guys pay attention to it.  No, they' re reminded on a regular basis,  and I can tell you that the Ed Diaz,  who' s chief of operations,  has been called by nearby residents to ask parents to,  you know,  leave the driveway or whatever. So,  we' re well aware of it\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF ARCHITECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Board of Architects, which approved the new building design after two reviews and requested windows on the eastern side of the building for aesthetic purposes, despite a prior master plan condition prohibiting windows on that side.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2001-2003 MASTER PLAN<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>The 2001-2003 master plan that included a condition prohibiting any windows on the eastern side of the building to avoid an institutional appearance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Planning and Zoning Board, before which the project appeared and which recommended approval with three conditions regarding window operability, maintaining existing conditions including child limits, and landscaping the front of the building.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHURCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The church associated with the school property, responsible for maintaining the swales of properties from Coral Way to Andalusia as per an additional condition added by the Planning and Zoning Board.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The nonprofit school occupying the building, serving 180 students since 2001, with no proposed increase in student numbers, actively trying to prevent parking on swales and regularly communicating parking rules to parents via monthly newsletters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWALES<|>PROJECT<|>The swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia, which the church was required to landscape and maintain as an additional condition imposed by the Planning and Zoning Board.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORAL WAY AND CORDOVA PROPERTY<|>PROJECT<|>The property at the northwest corner of Coral Way and Cordova, belonging to St. Philip's church, one of the four properties involved in the swale maintenance condition.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST.
