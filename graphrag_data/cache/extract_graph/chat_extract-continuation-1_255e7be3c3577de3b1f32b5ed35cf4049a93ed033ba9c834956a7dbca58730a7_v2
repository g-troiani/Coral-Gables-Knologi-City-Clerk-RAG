Echoing --  good morning, Commissioner,  Mr. Mayor.  Echoing my oldest friend...\n\nMayor Lago:   Can you put your name and address on the record?\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Sure,  Manny Chamizo,  1507 Sunset.   My oldest friend,  not because I'm old, it's because we' ve been friends since second grade.   Great,  great presentation.   Echoing exactly what Sarah had mentioned,  for me, it's --  sign pollution is critical.   I get it.  You drive around the City, other cities,  and you see billboards,  eight by 10, huge billboards.   I don' t see that issue here in Coral Gables.  To your point, Commissioner Fernandez,  as a commercial practitioner for 38 years, I can tell you that the signage is important.  It's important to identify the buildings,  especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   I'm not sure who you spoke to.  Most of the dominant players, I know who they are, and not all property is listed on the internet.   Sometimes you have to walk it and see it, especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   It' s not as, fortunately,  it' s not like residential real estate where it's a little bit more specific.   Vehicle count is very important.   Foot traffic is important,  parking is important.   So,  there' s a number of other things.   So,  my biggest question is what' s the specific reason? I mean,  other than the fact that I'm cognizant of the pollution,  I mean,  these signs are 12 by 10, whatever the number of square inches are, and you' re having this reduced to the smaller version or proposing to have it reduced.   I'm wondering with the hundreds and hundreds of other signs that I see that are billboard size signs,  including the wrapping of the outside of these buildings when they' re supposed to be temporary,  but I see them being there permanent,  what' s the impetus?   I'm just wondering,  and I'll say it in a simpler,  why pick on us?  I'm asking you specifically,  it's your --  it's your --  it's yourâ€¦\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Absolutely.\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Yeah.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   And you' re entitled to an answer.   It's really not picking on anybody. I think it' s just about uniformity.  It has worked in the residential space for years.  I don' t remember the date that I was given as to the change when it was made for the residential signs,  but most of the traffic that' s in front of our businesses,  which are blocked by parking, is pedestrian traffic.  So, your --  the argument could be made that you' re closer to the sign,  so a smaller sign should not have that much of an impact.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMr. Chamizo:   That argument,  unfortunately,  doesn' t hold true in a commercial space.   I mean,  as it is, we all wear glasses,  I'm getting older.   I can hardly see the little ones as it is right now.  So, and if you see the font on my phone,  you' ll see that it's huge.   You can probably read it from the dais.   Moving forward,  I think that echoing what Sarah had mentioned is, I believe that although it' s well thought out and I believe that your intentions are good,  I believe that you need a little bit more input from the community and understand,  having done this long enough,  I can tell you that I don' t like anyone stepping on my toes if it's something like this where it could impact our business.   So,  again,  I thank you all for your time.  I'll make it brief.  Let' s reconsider.   Let' s get the input from the community and move forward.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Thad Adams.\n\nMayor Lago:   Good morning,  sir.\n\nThad Adams:   Mr. Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  Commissioners,  it's a pleasure to be here.   My name is Thad Adams, 121 Alhambra Plaza, here on behalf of the Chamber as well, as immediate vice chair, and also happen to be like Manny,  35 years as a commercial real estate professional here,  along with 10 years of experience at the Beacon Council as an officer as it relates to economic development.   And so, we just had a nice chat out there.   I appreciate the goodwill and the intent, Commissioner Fernandez,  of you trying to make the City Beautiful more beautiful.   But there are some things,  had I not been in this business for so long, that may seem intuitive,  but they' re not, as Manny had spoken.   So, we actually believe that this is an 84 percent reduction in the sign.  So, you' re going from --  you' re really going to a postcard.   And real quick,  as we discussed,  people think signs are obsolete and that everyone uses the internet and the listing services. That is absolutely not true.   I have had multiple clients of mine that actually drive --  yeah,  even if I do a survey,  they' re still going\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANNY CHAMIZO<|>PERSON<|>Manny Chamizo, a commercial real estate professional with 38 years of experience, speaking about sign pollution and signage importance in Coral Gables, emphasizing the impact on commercial real estate and questioning the rationale behind proposed sign size reductions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a city commissioner responding to concerns about sign size reductions, advocating for uniformity in signage regulations and noting the difference between residential and commercial signage contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the City Commission Meeting, facilitating the discussion and acknowledging speakers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY CLERK URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Urquia, responsible for calling speakers during the City Commission Meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAD ADAMS<|>PERSON<|>Thad Adams, immediate vice chair of the Chamber and commercial real estate professional with 35 years of experience, also with 10 years at the Beacon Council in economic development, speaking in support of commercial real estate perspectives on signage regulations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, where discussions about signage regulations and commercial real estate concerns took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAMBER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chamber, represented by Thad Adams as immediate vice chair, involved in economic development and commercial real estate advocacy in Coral Gables.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANNY CHAMIZO<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>Manny Chamizo addresses Commissioner Fernandez directly, questioning the rationale behind sign size reductions and Commissioner Fernandez responds explaining the intent for uniformity.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>MANNY CHAMIZO<|>Mayor Lago facilitates the discussion and acknowledges Manny Chamizo's comments during the meeting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY CLERK URQUIA<|>THAD ADAMS<|>City Clerk Urquia calls Thad Adams to speak during the City Commission Meeting.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THAD ADAMS<|>CHAMBER<|>Thad Adams represents the Chamber as immediate vice chair and speaks on its behalf regarding signage and economic development.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THAD ADAMS<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>Thad Adams addresses Commissioner Fernandez, acknowledging his intent to beautify the city but raising concerns about the impact of signage size reductions on commercial real estate.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MANNY CHAMIZO<|>Manny Chamizo speaks at the City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>THAD ADAMS<|>Thad Adams speaks at the City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>Commissioner Fernandez participates in the City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>Mayor Lago presides over the City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
