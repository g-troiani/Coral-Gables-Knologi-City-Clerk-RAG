My name is Laura Russo with offices at 2334 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, and I am here this morning representing St.  Philip' s Episcopal Church and School. I have with me Reverend Mary Beth Conroy,  Ed Diaz,  who is Chief Operations Officer,  Norma Diaz,  who is Head of School,  also supporting us is Sissy Slesnick,  who is a parishioner,  Octavio Santurio,  who is the architect of the project.   I'll give you a little bit of background.   St. Philip' s has been in the City of Coral Gables as a church for 80 years.   The school has been in existence for 70 years.   For those of you who don' t know the exact location,  it is located on the block that is bounded by Coral Way to the north, Andalusia to the south,  Columbus to the west,  and Cordova to the east. Back in 2001 through 2003,  St. Philip' s underwent a master plan process.   And in that process,  it was proposing a new building,  but during that process,  it underwent a total review of its operations.   Conditions were imposed,  limiting the number of students,  setting up the drop-off operation,  legislating certain landscaping,  making sure that any changes to a site plan would go before a public hearing process, making decisions with respect to colors of the building so that the school would blend into the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential neighborhood,  parking for employees in the lot to the east of Salvadore Park,  and also dealing with special event permits for the special events that were held either by the school or by the church.   Again, to put it into a geographic location,  the school is located immediately north of Salvadore Park that as you know has a whole playground section,  tennis courts, a pickleball court, the little parking lot to the east and a dog park now. The request that we are making today is to demolish an existing building that sits at the southeast corner of the property on Andalusia and replace it with another building.   The idea is -- well, the reason for it is the building was old, had sagging floors and had a lot of issues and it made more sense to demolish the building and build a new one.   The new structure will be approximately the same size.   It will house the same two classrooms,  Pre-K 3, Pre-K 4, a multi-purpose room and storage area.  The difference in the square footage is that there is now a covered walkway that is a canopy and it's an awning and that,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-4<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda Item E-4, an ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip's School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new Pre-K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida; all other conditions of approval in Ordinance No. 3576 remain in effect; effective date provided.
