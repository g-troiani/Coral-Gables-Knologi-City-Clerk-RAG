It involves the design and implementation of vegetated areas intended to manage stormwater runoff, enhance aesthetic appeal, and contribute to environmental sustainability. In addition to its landscaping aspects, SWALE is also associated with public property areas where maintenance responsibilities and neighborhood parking issues are significant concerns. The discussions highlight the importance of clearly defining who is responsible for the upkeep of these public spaces to ensure their proper maintenance. Furthermore, the impact of SWALE installations on neighborhood parking has been a key topic, emphasizing the need to balance green infrastructure with community parking needs.
