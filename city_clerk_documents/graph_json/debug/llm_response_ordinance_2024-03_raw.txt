Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this ordinance document. The user wants only the code in the format AGENDA_ITEM: [code]. Let me start by scanning through the entire document text provided.

First, I'll look for any mention of "Agenda Item" or similar terms. The document is about amending sections of the Zoning Code. Near the end of the document, in the sections where the voting and passage details are mentioned, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-3)". Wait, there might be a typo here, maybe "AgendaItem" was misspelled as "AgendaItem", but the code is E-3. Let me check again.

Looking through the pages, towards the end, in the section after the vote details, I see "AgendaItem: E-3)" with some formatting issues. Another instance might be in the same area. The user said to check the entire document, so I need to be thorough. Scanning again, another occurrence is on Page 2 of the ordinance where it says "AgendaItem: E-3)" again. Even though there's a typo in "AgendaItem" (maybe missing a space or case), the code is E-3. There's no other code mentioned elsewhere. The example codes given by the user include formats like E-2, so E-3 fits the pattern. I don't see any other codes like F-10 or H-1 here. So the correct code is E-3.
