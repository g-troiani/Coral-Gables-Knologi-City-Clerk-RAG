It overrides individual local restrictions on density, allowing for a comprehensive analysis and regulation of density on a citywide scale. Under the Live Local Act, limited density is permitted in specific districts, ensuring that while overall density is controlled across the city, certain areas may experience increased development opportunities. This approach balances the need for managing urban growth with targeted flexibility in designated districts, promoting more consistent and strategic density planning throughout the city.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749233517, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
