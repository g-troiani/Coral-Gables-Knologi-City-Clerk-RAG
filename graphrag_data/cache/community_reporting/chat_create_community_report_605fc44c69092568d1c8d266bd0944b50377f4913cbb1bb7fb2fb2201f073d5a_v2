This authority includes initiating the conversion process at the property owner's expense, recording liens on the property, certifying expenses to the finance director, and enforcing payment through special assessment liens payable in installments with interest and penalties.

The 'Notice of Property Owner's Failure to Convert Facilities' is a critical document issued by the City Manager, demanding conversion within 60 days. This notice is primarily served by registered mail but includes alternative service methods such as personal delivery by law enforcement officers, physical posting on the property, or publication in newspapers to guarantee proper notification.
