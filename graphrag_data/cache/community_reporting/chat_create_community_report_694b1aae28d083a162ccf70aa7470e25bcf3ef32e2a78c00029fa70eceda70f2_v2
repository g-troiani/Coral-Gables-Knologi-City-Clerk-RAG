In November, the board recommended approval of a major amendment to the 2002 site plan for St. Philip's School, including the proposed preschool building. Their approval came with several conditions: windows on the new building were to remain fixed and inoperative, all previous conditions such as limits on student numbers were to be maintained, and heavy landscaping was required at the front of the building. Additionally, the board mandated that the church associated with the school landscape and maintain the swales on properties along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia, and they requested an expansion of these swale improvements in that area.\n\nThe board’s responsibilities extend beyond site plan approvals; it considers applications as part of the site plan review and approval process, thoroughly reviews the entire record after public hearings in accordance with the zoning code and specific municipal sections (62-328 and 62-330), and forwards its recommendations to the City Commission for final decisions. The Planning and Zoning Board also serves as a body to which City staff report during the Zoning in Progress Resolution process, receiving updates and recommendations related to zoning matters and moratoriums.\n\nMoreover, the board addresses neighborhood concerns related to traffic, property maintenance, parking, and landscaping, often directing improvements such as swale enhancements to mitigate environmental and community impacts. Through these functions, the Planning and Zoning Board acts as a critical intermediary between the public, city staff, and the City Commission, ensuring that development projects comply with zoning regulations while balancing neighborhood interests and environmental considerations.\",13\n766,SWALES,\"The swales of the properties from Coral Way to Andalusia, which the church was required to landscape and maintain as an additional condition imposed by the Planning and Zoning Board.\",2\n671,CHURCH,\"The church associated with St. Philip's plays a significant role in the maintenance and management of certain properties in its vicinity.
