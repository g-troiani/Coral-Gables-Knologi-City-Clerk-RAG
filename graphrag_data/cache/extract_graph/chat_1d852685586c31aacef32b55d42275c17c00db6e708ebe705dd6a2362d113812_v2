relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nEntity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION\nText: \"Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed. This is Ordinance 2024-01.\"\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, which is the same as Ordinance 2024-01 and amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, also known as agenda item E-1, which amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same as<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Real Data-\nEntity types: agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project\nText: binding agreement.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   Correct.   And if there was a violation,  then we would take action to enforce the covenant is what we would do.  That would be our recourse.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: And I agree,  there are other schools,  I know the charter school on Segovia,  when they were approved,  all the schools have their limitations.\n\nMs. Russo:   Gulliver,  St. Thomas also have student…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   But I know people are watching,  they want to know, well, is it binding? So, that' s good to know.  In terms of the footprint of the school,  Madam City Attorney,  when 2002 there were agreements,  things that were approved,  was the footprint of the school limited in any documentation?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  So, there is a site plan that was approved.   This is one of the buildings that is part of that site plan that it was --  the existing structure is smaller than what they are proposing. They' re proposing to demolish the existing building within the site plan and construct a larger building.   Is that accurate?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   How about the building itself?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   The building itself is the same size.   The extra square footage comes from the now enclosed concrete walkway for security purposes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I'm talking about the campus.\n\nMs. Russo:   Those of you with small children know that you can' t -- you don' t want access to children.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So,  this -my understanding is that this request does not change the boundaries of the site plan.\n\nMs. Russo:   That is correct.   The boundaries remain the same.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   My follow-up question,  and I totally understand having a property that people can --  visitors can stay, you know, close to the school,  the church.  When they acquired that property --  and I totally support and understand having it for guests --  did that change the footprint of the campus,  or is that something they should have notified the City that we' ve added a property?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  No, they have a right to purchase and own property.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   It has --  it is not connected to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.   Right, and no, I just want to check off the boxes.\n\nMs. Russo:   Yeah,  to connect it, let' s just say,  we' re not going to do it, but let' s just say,  it would have to come before DRC, it would have to go before the Planning and Zoning Board, and it would be a change in land use and a change in zoning and a major amendment to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Like I said,  the fact that you' re not having classes or events,  it's --  I understand the need for it.  I just don' t want to cross that line at any point because it' s not good for the school,  the church,  or the City in general,  or obviously,  the residents.   I totally support the direction my colleagues are headed with between first and second reading.   I personally suggest don' t bring this back on second reading unless there' s a true agreement because we don' t want to repeat today.   And with regards to signage,  the residential permit,  I asked the City Manager,  that area does qualify for it, but again,  things have to be enforced and we all know because we have traffic circles,  we have speed bumps,  sometimes physical additions are required because people just regardless of what the sign says,  do whatever they want.   So, I'm in support of the direction my colleagues are headed with this first to second reading.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay,  so we can close this out between first and second,  if I'm getting the vibe of what this Commission is headed. So,  we' re going to move forward on first reading.   To move forward,  obviously,  we' re going to take a vote now.   What we' re requesting between first and second is -- okay, would you like to say something?\n\nMs. Russo:   No, no.\n\nMayor Lago:   No, I just want to make sure.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'm just acknowledging that we' re going to be meeting with the City Attorney and City Manager.\n\nMayor Lago:   What I would like is for there to be a meeting between the applicant and the City, the City Attorney,  City Manager,  and yourself,  if any other residents would like to join, to make sure that we address the issues with the swales.   What are we talking about?   A swale package of one form or another,  or what the Vice Mayor said in regards to the opportunity to address resident parking,  which has to be enforced.   Again,  that puts another burden of proof on you, because I'll tell you why.   Because you have to call --  if someone parks there,  you have to call and get it enforced.   When you have the swale package in place, you' re not calling anybody because no one, unless they' re, you know,  destructive individuals and they park over the swale package,  I don' t think many people are going to park over that.
