This ordinance mandates a formal process that includes an advertised public bidding procedure, minimum advertisement standards, and proposal submission requirements. The ordinance ensures that property transactions are conducted transparently and competitively, protecting public interests and maximizing value for the city.

It mandates that sales or leases of city-owned property be publicly advertised with specific standards for advertisement size and headline font to ensure visibility and accessibility. This process requires the solicitation of proposals from prospective purchasers or lessees, with a minimum of three written proposals expected to foster competitive bidding. The process is designed to prevent favoritism and ensure that the city receives fair market value for its assets.

According to the ordinance, the commission can only consider such transactions after the advertised public bidding process has been completed and the required proposals have been received. The commission also has the authority to determine if exceptions to the minimum proposal requirement apply, particularly when fewer than three proposals are received.
