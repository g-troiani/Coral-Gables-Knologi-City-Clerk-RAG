Again, I'm happy moving forward with this. I do not believe that any employee is going to tell you that they believe they' re second class citizens,  because we' re doing a special ceremony to recognize them and I'm happy to make a motion to move this forward.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you make your motion.  I think also what you' re not recognizing is that you mentioned that we' re not following the schedule,  we' re not keeping time certain.  We had one item that was time certain today, and the conversation ran long in regard to the school,  but let' s be also very clear. We' re also incredibly lenient, incredibly lenient on the time that we give to all residents that speak. The gentleman who spoke not once,  but two times on the same issue, which is something that we don' t have to do, spoke for probably twelve minutes,  because I was looking at one point, he had gone over by three or four minutes,  which is perfectly fine. He had spent a huge amount of time working on that presentation.  If we were to do things like other cities,  and by the way,  I think we' re the only city in Miami-Dade County that gives this much deference and this much time to talk. Some of the things I was trying to get things in line in regard to public comment, again,  not stripping public comment,  we tried that. We tried to get it in line, but we give so much time in public comment that the meetings last very, very, long, very, very long, delaying,  and then we also have case in point, we have actual debates up here, Madam City Attorney, we have debates. We just had those nice family members,  the Toyos were having a full-fist conversation with the representative for the school,  along with our staff and we were going back and forth. As you know, correct me if I'm wrong, does that happen in any other city that you are aware of?\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  I can' t say Mayor.  We are very lenient,  or I should say very flexible in public comment and extending time for members of the public to speak.\n\nMayor Lago:  Madam City Attorney,  I know that you want to be respectful as possible.  You know the answer is no. The bottom line is very simple.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  It's not the answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is the answer.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not a yes or no answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  It is a yes or no answer,  Commissioner,  it is, because what ends up happening and I'll give you an explanation.  You know this very well because you visited many cities. What ends up happening is that they give you a public comment section at the beginning of the Commission, in the City of Miami,  Miami- Dade County,  other municipalities.  You speak about your issue and the item is presented,  and the Commission deliberates,  and we come to a conclusion.  There' s no back and forth. I've seen other cities the way they do it. I'm not saying that we do it the right way and they do it the wrong way or we do it the wrong way and they do it the right way.  I'm just\n\nsaying that we spend a lot of time giving a lot of public comments.  I think that Commissioner Menendez -  you talk about finding a middle ground,  you talk about to being on both ends of the discussion and taking a little bit from here and a little bit from here.  If you want to move forward on this, that' s fine, but why don' t we apply what Commissioner Menendez said which is, we do a little bit in the morning and we do a little bit in the afternoon,  and that way we address both issues and I'm willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning.  I think that' s perfectly fine, if you want to do it then.  I'll be willing to meet here at 8:30, it's not a precedent,  we did it under Raul, and it worked perfectly well. I never had an issue with it and the entire Commission was present,  all the employees liked it. So, I'm just telling you, meet us halfway so that we can get this done and move on to leave here by 2:30.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  Commissioner Menendez and Commissioner Fernandez,  would you be open to the idea of maybe having this first ceremony and then see what the input of the employees is, if they like it or not.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I think we' ve already done that though.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  No, no, no. The actual ceremony.  Not asking the question with however we word the survey questions,  actually having it, then being in it, and then deciding,  yes,  I like this more or no, I don' t like this more.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  That' s a pilot.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm not in favor of that.  I think it would be great to just do what Commissioner Menendez said and we move on.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I like the option that Commissioner Menendez suggested. Let' s try to organize our schedule better.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'm fine with starting earlier,  but I know there are folks that drop off their kids and that time is precious to a lot of people,  and we' re already here and staff included.  I would like the pilot to be morning and then like 12:30, see how it\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, who leads the City of Coral Gables Commission meetings and advocates for leniency and flexibility in public comment time, emphasizing the city's unique approach compared to other municipalities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a member of the City of Coral Gables Commission, who participates in discussions about meeting schedules, public comment procedures, and employee recognition ceremonies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a City of Coral Gables Commissioner who suggests finding a middle ground in scheduling public comments and meetings, advocating for splitting public comment time between morning and afternoon.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Castro<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, a City of Coral Gables Commissioner who proposes having a first ceremony to recognize employees and then gathering employee feedback on it.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, a City of Coral Gables official who supports Commissioner Menendez's suggestion to better organize the meeting schedule and expresses that a ceremony has already been done.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Madam City Attorney Suarez<|>PERSON<|>Madam City Attorney Suarez, the City Attorney for Coral Gables, who confirms the city's leniency and flexibility in public comment time and extending speaking time to members of the public.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Employee Recognition Ceremony<|>PROJECT<|>A special ceremony proposed to recognize City of Coral Gables employees, discussed as a pilot event to gauge employee feedback and considered in relation to meeting scheduling and public comment time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Public Comment<|>PROJECT<|>The public comment section during City of Coral Gables Commission meetings, characterized by leniency and flexibility in time allowances, allowing residents to speak extensively and engage in back-and-forth discussions with staff and representatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Meeting Schedule<|>PROJECT<|>The scheduling and timing of City of Coral Gables Commission meetings, including discussions about starting times, time certain items, and balancing public comment sessions between morning and afternoon.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Madam City Attorney Suarez<|>Mayor Lago asks Madam City Attorney Suarez about the city's leniency in public comment time, and she confirms it, showing their direct interaction on meeting procedures.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Public Comment<|>Mayor Lago emphasizes the city's unique and lenient approach to public comment time compared to other cities, highlighting its importance in meetings.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Meeting Schedule<|>Commissioner Menendez suggests splitting public comment time between morning and afternoon to find a middle ground in scheduling.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Castro<|>Employee Recognition Ceremony<|>Commissioner Castro proposes having the first employee recognition ceremony and then gathering employee feedback on it.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Employee Recognition Ceremony<|>Vice Mayor Anderson states that the employee recognition ceremony has already been done, indicating familiarity and involvement.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Employee Recognition Ceremony<|>Commissioner Fernandez refers to the employee recognition ceremony as a pilot and expresses interest in its timing and employee reception.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Meeting Schedule<|>Mayor Lago discusses meeting start times, leniency on time certain items, and suggests meeting earlier to accommodate schedules.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Meeting Schedule<|>Commissioner Fernandez discusses starting meetings earlier but notes concerns about personal schedules such as dropping off kids.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Commissioner Menendez and Commissioner Fernandez are jointly involved in discussions about meeting scheduling and employee recognition ceremonies.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Vice Mayor Anderson supports Commissioner Menendez's suggestion to better organize the meeting schedule.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Mayor Lago and Commissioner Fernandez engage in a back-and-forth about the appropriateness of answers regarding meeting procedures.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
