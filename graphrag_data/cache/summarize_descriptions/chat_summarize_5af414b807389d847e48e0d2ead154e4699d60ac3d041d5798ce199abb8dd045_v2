This amount represents both an estimated cost and an allocated budget for undergrounding power lines and other infrastructure improvements within the city. Initially, the 275 million dollars was considered as the estimated cost that would have been required if a referendum vote had been necessary to approve the undergrounding of power lines. Subsequently, this figure evolved into an allocated budget, reflecting a compromise to initiate a long-term project focused on revamping and beautifying Coral Gables' infrastructure. The project is planned to span 10 to 15 years, aiming to enhance the city's aesthetic appeal and modernize its utility systems through extensive underground infrastructure improvements. Overall, the 275 million dollars symbolizes a major investment by Coral Gables to improve its urban environment and utility reliability over the coming decade and beyond.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762945, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
