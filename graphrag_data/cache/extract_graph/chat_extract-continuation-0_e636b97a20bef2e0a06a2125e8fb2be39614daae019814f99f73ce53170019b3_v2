strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

For some reason I thought that maybe being outside pushed the protocol documents faster,  maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like it was kind of a much faster process.  I said,  let' s get here earlier and let' s get it done.  I'm more than willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning,  at 8:30, get it done,  and we meet the goals of the employees who they stated very clearly by the poll that we took that they would rather have it here and we meet the goal of getting here as quickly as possible and the residents can get here at 9 o' clock, 9:15, to have their items heard in a timely manner without any delays from the protocol section of the meeting.  Does that opportunity work for you?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s definitely one option.  I know we discussed that when this first came up.  Other than presentations and obviously the recognition,  Employee of the Month,  its September so we' re recognizing, is there a way to manage how many protocol items are per Commission meeting?  Can we cap it a little bit better because if you look at it, there are months\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nthat we have an hour-and-a-half, two hours, and then there are other meetings that we have, we' re done in 40 minutes or 35 minutes.  Is there a way to manage what comes before us?\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  There could be. From the employee perspective,  there' s not that many employees that we recognize.  Its an Employee of the Month,  at least from the general employees, right.  So that' s one employee per month,  not including Police and Fire that are recognized every month.  What we tend to do is, we usually save -  so right now we' re in the process of selecting our November,  December and January employees and we are going to bring them before you in February.  So, we usually do about three general employees per Commission meeting every four or five Commission meetings.  As to the protocols,  that all depends.  A lot of the protocols are directed by you all, right.  It' s Disability Awareness Month,  Alzheimer' s Month,  there' s a lot of different types of protocols that HR doesn' t manage,  that usually comes out of one of your offices or one of the different department' s offices.  Can we cap it?  We can cap it, but thenâ€¦\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I have a suggestion.  Can we identify,  just brainstorming,  identify those items that can go in the morning and perhaps have the other ones maybe at noon, split it so that we can start the day getting to work and getting to business.  Have particular identify which ones would be the morning protocols and then at 12 or 12:30 we stop for 30 minutes to do, that way at least we get the day rolling. Otherwise,  we' re all here happy to recognize,  but it really delays the ability to move the agenda.\n\nMayor Lago:  I would support that.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I also have another suggestion as well. We' ve been utilizing it and that is these time certain items. For instance,  the time that there was an 11 o' clock time certain, we paused for a moment,  because it was already 11:15, and I understand that Commissioner Fernandez was presenting at the time,  but we paused for a moment so we could take a speaker who is a businessperson, a resident of our community and allow them to speak.  So,  we as a Commission can better organize our Commission agenda by having time certains for things that people do want to come here and speak on, other than the general time that we have for public comment.  We could even put the general time for public comment as a time certain as well, so people know what time they can come in for the general public comment.  It's just a matter of scheduling.  I deal with schedules every single day when I'm dealing with courts and various people come in and any time that you ignore the overwhelming desire of the Police and Fire people to be recognized in a general meeting where everybody is there,  as opposed to just a resident showing up. And I'm not talking about whether or not this Commission shows up. I'm talking about whether residents are seeing what' s going on, then it is a second- class designation that you give to somebody when they are not in a general meeting itself,  because that' s the purpose here,  to recognize.  You don' t recognize somebody by not including them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think second class is also stating an 11 a.m. time certain,  not taking the item until 11:57. Like we did today to give preference to another item, because we had folks from the Chamber here.  We' re bordering on just choosing who we want to select as first class\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ncitizens when we are saying,  we' re going to stop the discussion on this item which everybody was listening to and we had members in the room who were here to speak on the item,  residents, because we had one person who we wanted to discuss one item on and we decided to take that item first. Again, I'm happy moving forward with this. I do not believe that any employee is going to tell you that they believe they' re second class citizens,  because we' re doing a special ceremony to recognize them and I'm happy to make a motion to move this forward.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you make your motion.  I think also what you' re\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>MEETING<|>A meeting of the City Commission of Coral Gables where discussions about protocol items, employee recognitions, and agenda management took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a member of the City Commission who suggested managing the number of protocol items per meeting and splitting protocol recognitions between morning and noon sessions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta<|>PERSON<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta, responsible for employee recognitions, explained the process of recognizing employees of the month and the scheduling of protocol items.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Employee of the Month<|>PROJECT<|>A recurring recognition project for employees, including general employees, Police, and Fire personnel, typically recognizing one employee per month.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding officer of the City Commission meeting, who supported suggestions to improve meeting protocol scheduling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, a member of the City Commission who suggested using time certain items to better organize the Commission agenda and public comment periods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a member of the City Commission who commented on the fairness of time certain scheduling and the treatment of recognized individuals.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Commissioner Menendez participated in the City Commission Meeting discussing protocol item management and scheduling.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta provided information about employee recognitions during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Employee of the Month<|>The Employee of the Month recognition was discussed as part of the protocol items in the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Mayor Lago<|>Mayor Lago presided over and contributed to the City Commission Meeting discussions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Vice Mayor Anderson contributed suggestions during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Commissioner Fernandez participated in the City Commission Meeting and commented on agenda item scheduling.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Employee of the Month<|>Commissioner Menendez referenced the Employee of the Month recognition when discussing protocol item management.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta<|>Employee of the Month<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta described the Employee of the Month recognition process and scheduling.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Vice Mayor Anderson suggested time certain scheduling to improve the City Commission Meeting agenda management.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Commissioner Fernandez discussed fairness and scheduling issues related to agenda items during the City Commission Meeting.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
