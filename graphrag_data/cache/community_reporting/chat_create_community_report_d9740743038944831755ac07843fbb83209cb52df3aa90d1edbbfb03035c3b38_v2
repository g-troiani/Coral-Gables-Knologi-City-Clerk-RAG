Small businesses, in particular, depend on physical signage more than other marketing methods, especially those less familiar with online listing services. This reliance underscores the importance of signage in attracting attention to available commercial properties and supporting business operations. Commercial real estate brokers also depend on signage for marketing and leasing activities, highlighting its integral role in the commercial property market. Buyers use signage to identify available properties, indicating that signage directly influences market visibility and transaction opportunities. The prominence of real estate signs is thus a critical factor shaping the commercial real estate landscape in this community [Data: Entities (610, 603, 606, 609); Relationships (582, 585, 589)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Small businesses' limited use of online listing services\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Small businesses within this community show a notable preference for physical real estate signs over online listing platforms. They are less familiar with services like CoStar and LoopNet, which are recognized alternatives for advertising commercial properties. This limited adoption of online tools suggests potential barriers such as lack of awareness, technological challenges, or preference for traditional marketing methods. Consequently, small businesses' marketing effectiveness may be constrained by their reliance on signage, which could impact their ability to reach broader markets.
