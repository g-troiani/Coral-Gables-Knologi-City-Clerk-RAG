Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user said it can be anywhere, so I have to check the entire text. Let me start skimming through the provided text.

Looking at the beginning sections, there's the ordinance number and various sections being amended. The main body has sections like WHEREAS clauses and the sections of the ordinance. Maybe the agenda item is in the sections towards the end.

Lookinging through page 3, there's a section after the adoption details. Let me check the end parts. 

Wait, near the end of the document, after the sections and before the exhibits, there's a part where it says "AgendaItem: E-2)" right after the vote details. Let me confirm:

In the text provided, on Page 2 of 3, after the vote record:

"PASSED ANDADOPTED THISNINTHDAYOFJANUARY, A.D., 2024. 
Moved: Anderson / Seconded: Fernandez) 
Yeas: Anderson, Castro, Fernandez, Menendez, Lago) 
Unanimous: 5-0Vote) 
AgendaItem: E-2) 
APPROVED: 
VINCELAGO
MAYOR...

Yes, there it is. The line says "AgendaItem: E-2)". The code is E-2. I should make sure there's no other code elsewhere. Scanning the rest, like the exhibits sections, but the rest are sections of the code amendments. No other agenda items mentioned. So the correct code is E-2.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-2
