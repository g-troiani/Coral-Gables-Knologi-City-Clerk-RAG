This is not on them.   So, we just want a solution,  but we also want to know --  there' s two issues here.   They bought that house in 2016 and now has an exemption.   So, they' re paying $ 67. So, I imagine that they' re having a school and it says an educational exemption on that property in the corner right across from us.  And by the way, we' re only 130 feet.  We might not be adjacent, but our radius,  we' re 130 feet from their closest property line, their campus property line.  So,  if they' re there and they' re claiming that exemption,  what' s the use of this property?   Because this is what' s causing the issues. If they' re going to keep on buying single- family homes and converting them over into school space,  it defeats the purpose.   They have no parking.   They have zero parking.   This should have been done with 30, 40 years ago when they expanded or they did this amendment and all that stuff.  This should have taken place because they just didn' t have the parking.   This is a -- they have unique circumstances than other schools,  okay?  St. Teresa,  Ponce, Coral Gables,  all those schools,  they have parking.   They don' t have parking.   They do not have parking.  So, we need to come up with a solution,  okay, where they actively patrol or do something, but they' re not doing that.   But then we also need to know,  what are their future plans?   Are we going to keep on --  they' re one single- family home away from owning all of Coral Way,  okay, Orlando' s home and the one that they bought here.   And that' s it, we' re done.   So,  what is the future plans here?  And what are we going to do about the parking?  Because yeah,  we do want it addressed. We don' t want our parking -our driveways blocked,  and we don' t want our grass dead.   We want to be good neighbors,  and we want them to have their building.  We don' t have an issue with their building.   Who doesn' t want that?   And I mean,  I don' t have an issue with the building.   We do have an issue, two things, future plans, expansion,  and our parking situation.   It's not actively being dealt with.  You could put that in those papers and those newsletters.   Hey, how many emails do we send out and we just go pass,  pass,  pass,  pass?   That' s a newsletter. Same thing here.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:   But before you leave, Mr. Clerk, how many individuals\n\ndo we have?\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:   That' s it, okay,  so we' ll close the public comment.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'd like rebuttal.\n\nMayor Lago:   I know.\n\nMs. Russo:   Okay.\n\nMayor Lago:   I just want to put something on the record so my colleagues -is there one or two readings here?\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSu√Ürez:   Two readings,  sir.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two readings,  okay.  So, we may move forward as a Commission today.  I think it's important to continue to strive for the best education for the community. I mean,  again,  we' re having major issues here in South Florida, especially here in Coral Gables.  In addressing the needs to educate our young children here, we have a disaster.   I mean,  I get calls constantly from people, hey,  help me try to get my kids into the school,  and I tell them the same thing.   I say,  I have no power to get anybody into any school.   Call your school board member or call the owner of the school and see if they can help you,  but again at the end of the day,  we fail on that front.   But I also have an issue with the encroachment in the residential neighborhoods. There has to be something done for the future.   We' ve got to start working together and planning.   I'm going to say something that you' re not going to like and maybe some of your residents may not like, but we need to figure out a way to either build some sort of parking structure,  one or two floors, something that works for the community that can be done in a way that, you know, wraps the first floor in maybe offices or educational because if they' re going to continue to expand,  you know, at the end of the day, you' re going to have to address the parking issue.   Because you' re not going to be able to meet the parking needs.   You' re not going to.  And there' s also --  I was looking at the minutes from the Planning and Zoning Board meeting\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-4<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-4 discussed at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning an ordinance amending St. Philip's School site plan)<##>\n(\"entity\"<|>3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Permanent ordinance number approving St. Philip's School site plan, referenced in relation to agenda item E-4 and the amendment ordinance)<##>\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where agenda item E-4 and related ordinances were discussed)<##>\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE NO. 3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Permanent ordinance number approving St. Philip's School site plan, referenced multiple times in the amendment ordinance related to agenda item E-4)<##>\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance discussed under agenda item E-4 amending the St. Philip's School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre-K building at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida)<##>\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor presiding over the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, providing remarks on education and parking issues related to the agenda item)<##>\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
