Enacted by the Florida Legislature during the 2023 session, it establishes requirements and preemptions related to affordable housing and local law governance, particularly affecting zoning and building regulations. This Act serves as the legal basis for height and signage restrictions in Coral Gables’ zoning districts MX2 and MX3, ensuring that local development aligns with state-level affordable housing policies and urban planning objectives.
