The presentation and the heartfelt words spoken during the meeting added an invaluable layer of significance.\n\nIntegrating awards to our police officers into commission meetings amplifies the significance of their achievements within the broader community.  By incorporating these recognitions into such sessions,  we emphasize the importance of law enforcement in our society and showcase the commitment and sacrifices made. This is true for all our first responders and public service members.  This inclusion allows for a broader audience, from community members to local officials, to witness and appreciate the commendable work done.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nConducting these award ceremonies within commission meetings offers a powerful message of support and appreciation for our police force. It underlines the transparency and accountability of our governing bodies,  ensuring that the commendable actions of officers are acknowledged in an open and inclusive environment.  This recognition not only boosts the morale of our officers but also fosters a stronger bond between law enforcement and the community they serve,  promoting a sense of unity and mutual respect.\n\nI want to thank you for setting the stage with your continued support and inclusion of these important recognitions during commission meetings. It is an incredibly meaningful and impactful way to honor their service while fostering a deeper connection between the community and those who serve and protect it.'   I understand your point and we all can do our part on reducing the length of some of our comments,  but I read this into the record to make very,  very clear the feelings of the individuals that were here this morning and if we reflect upon the last Sunshine meeting that we were at regarding proposed change of our zoning code,  I think we had 8 or 9 individuals from the public there. It's a huge difference when you have people here that watch Commission meetings and watch reruns of Commission meetings,  they are unlikely to be watching reruns of a separate meeting at a separate time, because they are interested really in what' s happening here at our Commission every day, what is it that we' re doing.  So, I think that Mrs. Aleman' s comments adequately summarize my viewpoint on this and where I stand on it. I think it' s really important that we honor our first responders in a respectful manner and not in a separate meeting where they are less important and like second class citizens.\n\nMayor Lago: So, if I may, I want to dovetail off your comments.  I wholeheartedly agree with you. So,  this was sent to the entire Commission at 12:46 ( pm)  and it caught me off guard,  because it was very well written and she was so adamant about honoring,  about having her son honored before the Commission.  The Commission requested for a poll to be compiled and we went through the process to really understand what the residents, excuse me,  what the employees wanted, whether they are Police, Fire,  or General Employees, they are employees. What were the percentages in that number?\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  The survey was conducted by HR.\n\nDeputy City Attorney Throckmorton: I'll ask the Human Resources Director to answer those questions for you.\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  Good afternoon.  The survey was conducted back in August of last year, 2023.  So,  205 employees responded that they would like to keep the current practice of being recognized here before City Commission and 174 employees responded that they would like a separate ceremony.\n\nMayor Lago:  My point is that, listen,  it's something that works. If you look at it today,  right now it' s 2 o' clock,  we have three items left that are City Manager items that we' ll fly by them.  We' ll be out of here by 2:30. I think, again,  when you talk about the employees,  all the employees that\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nI've talked to, they like to have these meetings be present before the Commission,  and I don' t think it' s really that much of a big deal.  We went through the process to get input from the employees, they like it here, we want to move forward with that, and I think its appropriate also when you hear from parents and from individuals who are being honored before the Commission, its their moment.  Its their moment to shine,  its their moment to highlight all the great things that they do for the residents or for the business community,  and I think it just makes sense to keep it here.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I don' t think moving it diminishes the recognition and I think the Vice Mayor' s comments of calling it second class citizens is inflammatory and unnecessary.  The change is just about making sure that the focus of the Commission during Commission meetings can be focused on the needs of residents and the recognition still takes place in a forum which is specific to the recognition,  and I think the conversation that we' ve had and even Commissioner Castro added to make sure that there was some sort of reception following so that they could interact with the members of the Commission, not spend two seconds here taking a photo with a quick handshake and a photo.  I think it's a place where we could focus on the individuals and focus on those that are being recognized and making sure that they are properly recognized,  and the focus of the Commission during Commission meetings is Commission meetings. I've had several Commission meetings since August,  where the presentation and protocols have been close to an hour and forty-five minutes,  and that' s time that could have been focused on the residents who are in the room waiting for their items to be called up. In some cases,  time certain items that weren' t called up on time certain times, because we weren' t able to get to them on time\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>Regular meeting of the City Commission where various agenda items, recognitions, and discussions take place, including award ceremonies for police officers and other public service members.
