The Notices entity is highly connected, linking to Alleged Violators, Managers of Commercial Premises, and specific notice types such as Notice of Violation and Summons for Hearing. This centrality underscores the importance of Notices in maintaining regulatory compliance and due process within the community [Data: Entities (213, 220, 224, 233, 234); Relationships (254, 258, 259, 260, 261)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Multiple delivery methods ensure effective notice dissemination\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The community employs several delivery methods to serve notices, including certified mail, hand delivery, and posting.

Posting involves placing notices on the property where the violation occurred and at city hall, with proof of posting documented by affidavits.
