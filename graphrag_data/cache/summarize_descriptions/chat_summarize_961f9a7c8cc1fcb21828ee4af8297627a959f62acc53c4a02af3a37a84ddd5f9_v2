It plays an important role in connecting various parts of the county, including Coral Gables, and is considered essential for improving transit accessibility. There have been suggestions to expand and enhance the Metrorail network by establishing connections to significant locations such as Homestead, Florida International University (FIU), Miami-Dade College, Miami Beach, and the Miami International Airport. Despite its importance, the Metrorail system currently faces challenges and is viewed as less developed or comprehensive compared to major transportation hubs in cities like Atlanta, New York, and Washington, D.C.
