Since 1980, the board has played a key role in identifying and standardizing streetlight types in Coral Gables, working collaboratively with the City of Coral Gables, the Landmarks Advisory Board, city staff, and other advisors. This collaboration has included joint meetings directed by various city resolutions, such as Resolution F-11 and Resolution 2024-03, which tasked the Historic Preservation Board and the Landmarks Advisory Board with researching and recommending a city standard streetlight and discussing the replacement of certain Florida Power and Light streetlights throughout the city.\n\nIn addition to its work on streetlight preservation and standardization, the Historic Preservation Board is authorized to consider and grant Special Certificates of Appropriateness for properties within Coral Gables. These certificates are required for certain actions affecting historic properties and involve a public notice and posting at least ten days prior to public hearings to ensure community involvement. The board may grant Special Certificates of Appropriateness for moving significant historic improvements if preserving them on their original site is not feasible. In such cases, the relocation site must be compatible with the historic and architectural integrity of the improvement to maintain its preservation value.\n\nOverall, the Historic Preservation Board serves as a vital entity in Coral Gables’ efforts to protect its historic character, overseeing both the preservation of architectural elements and the standardization of historic streetlighting, while ensuring that any modifications or relocations of historic properties are carefully reviewed and approved in accordance with preservation standards.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840819, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 407, "total_tokens": 726, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
