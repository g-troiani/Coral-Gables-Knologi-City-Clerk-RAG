their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

Can you hear me?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes sir.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Okay. Good afternoon,  everyone,  Aky Fernandez,  1542 Mendavia.  I'm a resident of the city lifelong.  Also, an architect and a builder.  Happy with this proposed legislation.  I think it' s a step in the right direction.  The only thing that I will say after sort of reading through it, you know frankly,  the reductions that are being proposed while I think they are well-intentioned,  I actually don' t think it' s going to go a significant way in terms of making the final product more affordable.  To be frank,  they need to be more generous,  the parking reductions,  if we' re actually going to see some of this inventory get built. I'll give you an example.  I have a project that I'm working on now, 10,000 square- foot project, we can fit anywhere between 15 to 16 parking spaces on that parcel,  surface parking.  You know, under this legislation,  a ten percent reduction would be a space and-a-half, maybe two spaces,  if I get a good interpretation.  That' s not necessarily going to make a huge difference in terms of how affordable the units are going to be.  I think maybe something that would help sort of give some reference is actually a local precedent that we have in Miami-Dade County, there' s something called the Urban Center Program;  and within the Urban Center Program sort of very similar along the lines of trying to give parking discounts for workforce housing along transit,  they basically -  I'm happy to share it with the Clerk and maybe he can distribute it to you all. They have a tiered system which basically gives a by-right workforce reduction of 25 percent and then when you are building within 500 feet of a rail station,  you can actually qualify for up to 100 percent reduction and then it goes in terms of, and then it reduces based on how far you are from a bus stop, etc., goes all the way to ten percent reduction.  And then the way that they do it in terms of parcel size is that parcels less than 15,000 square feet get up to 100 percent reduction,  and then parcel size between 15 to 30,000 feet get a 60 percent reduction; parcels greater than 30,000 get a 20 percent parking reduction.  And that' s kind of the way they do it. It' s just an idea.  I understand that this is a new sort of program that we have to, I think the Commission is obligated to at least try to make some kind of accommodation for parking,  but I think this is a reference that could sort of help guide the conversation.  And I just wanted to share it with you all. Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Aky, thank you. I've had the pleasure meeting with Mr. Fernandez,  a very bright, young architect who has an interesting vision and take on potentially offering affordability in this community,  and he' s doing some interesting projects,  not only locally,  but throughout South Florida.  One of the big issues that we have to find a balance for, and this is something that I' ve\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ntalked to with Mr. Fernandez,  we' ve met on several occasions,  is the issue of finding that balance when you' re reducing parking.  One of the issues that we face today,  as you saw with the school, was,  if you reduce parking and we really don' t have a sufficient transit system,  that' s why years ago, and I lost on this. I advocated and the Commission supported me on a resolution to have actual rail on the south corridor and not to do BRT,  because I knew that the hundreds of millions of dollars that we' re spending on BRT, we're going to fall short on really delivering on worldclass transportation. Now we're seeing that already.  To really be able to provide massive parking reductions like other cities have done, for example,  New York, which some buildings don' t even have parking,  you really have to have a robust transportation system that really delivers on moving people.  Our bus system is not where it should be, number one,  and people are not going to ride, excuse me, not going to ride two or three or four modalities to get to work. What are the modalities? the bus, the people- mover,  the BRT, and then Metrorail.  In certain cases,  people are riding four modalities to get to work, two or three hours to get to work. They are just going to stick with their car.  So,  if we do significant parking reductions,  which again,  I think we need to do in the future, if we' re really going to be able to address the issue of affordability in our community,  especially for teachers,  police, fire, first responders,  the issue has to be where can we deliver on transportation so that people really,  really don' t need to use vehicles.  So,  he has an interesting concept that he showed me which I recommend that you show it to the other Commissioners that deals with Ponce, facing the Metrorail and it would be something interesting if that Metrorail connected to something for example,  Homestead,  FIU, Miami-Dade College,  Miami Beach,  where people could actually ride transportation and use one modality all the way from work and home. I recommend that you meet with him.
