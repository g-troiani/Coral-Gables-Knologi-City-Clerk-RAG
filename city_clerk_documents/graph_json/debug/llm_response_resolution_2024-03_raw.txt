Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to search the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by reading through the entire document text carefully. The document is split into two pages. Let me go through each part step by step.

Looking at the first page, the resolution is numbered 2024-03. The title mentions directing the City Clerk to schedule a joint meeting between two boards. The WHEREAS clauses talk about FPL replacing streetlights and the Commission wanting the boards to discuss replacements. The sections of the resolution outline the confirmation of the WHEREAS clauses, directing the meeting, and details about public notice.

Now, moving to the second page. The end of the document has the passage date: January 9, 2024. There's a list of the votes: Moved by Fernandez, seconded by Castro, with Yeas from all five commissioners. Then, right after the vote details, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: F-11)". 

Ah, here it is! The line "AgendaItem: F-11)" stands out. The format matches the examples given, like F-10 or H-1. The code here is F-11. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning again through the document, the rest of the text includes the approved signatures and legal attestation, but no other agenda item codes. The only instance is "AgendaItem: F-11)" on the second page. 

The user specified to return ONLY the code, so I should ignore everything else. The example responses show that even if there's a closing parenthesis, the code itself is just the letters and numbers. So F-11 is the correct code here. 

No need to explain, just the code. Let me confirm once more. The document's end has that line, and no other references. Definitely F-11.
