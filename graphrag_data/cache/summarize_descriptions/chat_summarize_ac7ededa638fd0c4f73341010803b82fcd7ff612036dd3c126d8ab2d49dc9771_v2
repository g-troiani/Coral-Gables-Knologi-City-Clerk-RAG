Specifically, it applies to the building of bulkheads, seawalls, groins, breakwaters, wharves, docks, piers, and other related shore structures. This permit is issued by the city public works department, following approvals from the city commission and other relevant agencies, ensuring that all construction complies with local regulations and environmental considerations. The permit is typically valid for less than one year, although extensions may be granted under certain circumstances to accommodate project timelines.\n\nHowever, the permit is not universally required for all shoreline-related activities. For example, certain landscaping activities, particularly those covered under the Swale Package, are exempt from this permit requirement. This exemption facilitates simpler processes such as hand drawing and the installation of native plants, promoting environmentally friendly landscaping practices without the need for formal permitting.\n\nIn summary, the PERMIT serves as a crucial regulatory tool for managing construction and shore activities on submerged or tidal lands within the city, balancing development needs with environmental protection, while allowing exemptions for specific low-impact landscaping projects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749563697, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 460, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
