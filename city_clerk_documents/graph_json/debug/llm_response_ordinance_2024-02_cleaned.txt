Okay, I need to find the agenda item code from this ordinance document. The user wants only the code in the format AGENDA_ITEM: [code]. Let me start by skimming through the entire document.

Looking at the first few pages, the main body of the ordinance lists various sections being amended, but I don't see an agenda item code there. The WHEREAS clauses and sections 1 to 7 at the beginning don't mention an agenda item. 

Continuing to the end of the document, there are several sections like Sec. 1-2, 2-464, 2-1091, etc., which are code sections being amended. But those are part of the ordinance's content, not the agenda item code.

Wait, near the end of page 2, after the list of votes, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-2)". That looks like the code. Let me check again. Yes, right after the vote section: "AgendaItem: E-2)". The formatting might have been easy to miss because of the hyphen and lowercase "agendaitem", but the code is E-2. I should confirm there's no other code mentioned elsewhere. Scanning again, the rest of the document doesn't have another code. So the correct code is E-2.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-2
