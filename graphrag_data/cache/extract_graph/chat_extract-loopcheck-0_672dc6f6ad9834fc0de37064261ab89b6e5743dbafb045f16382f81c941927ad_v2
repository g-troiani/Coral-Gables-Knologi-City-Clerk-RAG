AGENDA_ITEM: ANY mention of agenda items (E-1, F-10, Item E-1, Agenda Item E-1)\n2. ORDINANCE: BOTH filing numbers (2024-01) AND permanent numbers (Ordinance 3576)\n3. RESOLUTION: BOTH filing numbers (2024-123) AND permanent numbers\n4. PERSON: Officials, citizens, staff\n5. ORGANIZATION: Departments, companies, agencies\n6. DOCUMENT_NUMBER: ANY document identifier (capture all formats)\n7. CROSS_REFERENCE: When one document references another\n\n-Critical Instructions-\n- Extract EVERY agenda item mentioned, even in passing\n- Extract BOTH types of ordinance/resolution numbers\n- When you see \"Ordinance 2024-01\" AND \"Ordinance No. 3576\", extract BOTH\n- Extract relationships between agenda items and ordinances\n- Look for patterns like:\n  - \"(Agenda Item: E-1)\"\n  - \"Item E-1\"\n  - \"Ordinance 2024-01\"\n  - \"Ordinance No. 3576\"\n  - \"relating to agenda item\"\n  - \"concerning item\"\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Why don' t we, at the next Commission meeting,  put together something that deals with the morning and an afternoon session,  and we' ll see how that goes with the approval of the Commission through the Manager and we find a solution for that.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  So,  I guess what you' re suggesting is, at 9 a.m. we start with presentation and protocol.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  9:30 we do time certain public comment.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we go earlier. Why don' t we do 8:30? Why not?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Because there are members of staff are coming not from here, there are members of staff who live in Kendall,  who live in Homestead.  You' re affecting…\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on. Hold on. Mr. Manager,  when are employees supposed to be here at work?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  At 8 o' clock.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s their job.  So,  if they are coming from Kendall or from anywhere,  they are coming,  at the end of the day, they have got to be here by 8.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I will withdraw my idea. Look, simple.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach objects.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: I know.  Sorry.  Trial run 9 a.m.  obviously we do the Pledge of Allegiance,  maybe we' re done by 9:30, 9:40, we go to Public Comments,  Time Certain 12:30, and if we' re having a good day, we have lunch right after maybe 15 minutes and we come back to wrap up. At least we have structure and I think if we' re all supportive of that structure,  it will help us make it happen.  So that' s just me. If it doesn' t work, we' ll come up with another.\n\nMayor Lago:  Is that a motion? Want to second that?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Wait. What time is the…\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on a second.  Hold on. Hold on.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, because I have a question.\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I just have a question about,  what time is the second presentation protocol?\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And then lunch right after that.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Right after.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  I'll second.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, question.  Is this direction to start this next meeting or is this…?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes. Yes.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  All in favor.\n\nAll: Aye.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Anyone opposed?\n\nMayor Lago:  By the way, employees will still be here at 8 o' clock though,  so we could start at 8.
