There' s the potential for some of the signals that may need to be adjusted. If this is something that the Commission desires to move forward with, you know,  we will need about $35,000 for a conceptual layout and $45,000 for a traffic study, just so that we can, obviously\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nthis is a very crude,  we can get some professionals to really tell us what this could be,  and also start having the conversation with the county as to whether they even consider allowing us to do this, right. So, what we need right now is direction from the Commission whether this is something that you would like us to proceed with and obviously we would need the funding so we can start the process.\n\nMayor Lago:  So again,  right now I don' t think it's feasible in regard to funding.  I think this is a great project to do something spectacular,  especially in our downtown,  but unless my colleagues can envision something else and can provide more guidance,  I would love nothing more than to get Pittman Park activated and to do something special there, but with that building right next door, there are very nice ladies who own that building,  but we haven' t even had that conversation with them.  I wanted to talk to the Commission first,  but obviously with a service alley and how we would have to incorporate the service alley and cut it adjacent to the building.  I think it would cut in way too much into the plaza. It's kind of a tough project at the current moment,  but you never know what happens in the future.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: It's a tough geometry for sure.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes, it is. Well said.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think there was definitely an appetite to do something here,  having walked the area. I agree. I just don' t see a way to make it feasible.  The only way that this will work out would be to close down Galiano Street and I don' t think the county would ever approve that. And again,  you have businesses that would be impacted,  the parking garage access.  So,  I think maybe in the future if there' s a way to do something,  it would work. Maybe Parks Department can try to find a way to activate Pittman Park and in next year' s budget find ways to make it a little more attractive to get people out there. It's just a very small space too.\n\nMayor Lago: The play there, again, we' re talking about it,  we might as well dream,  right. The play is to be able to buy the office building.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Right.\n\nMayor Lago:  When it ever does come for sale. One day it will come for sale, maybe 10 years,  15, 20 years,  nobody thought those lots on Granada and Bird would ever come up for sale,  we found them when they went up for sale.  So that is a piece of property that if it did come up for sale,  I think would alleviate a lot of the concerns on the service alley,  because we could potentially do something great there, because I don' t think any 18-wheeler goes all the way deep into that because they can' t make the corner around that building.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Delivery trucks can' t.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  You could do a smaller rotunda there in the back.  You could do a smaller rotunda, you could do something where it goes into in between the larger building and the building that I'm talking about that those two nice ladies own, you could do something there,  but again,  this is just dreaming,  but if you could incorporate that building then you could do something.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: That' s a whole different conversation.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s a whole different conversation.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Absolutely.\n\nMayor Lago:  That is a whole different conversation because you could put a cul-de-sac right in front of that building,  so if cars come you could go,  you could even go into Pittman Park and maybe take a corner of it and do something great.  You would take all those parking spaces on both sides and then you would have more flexibility to do something great.  But I wanted to bring this to your attention because,  if you see opportunities like this, which is something that I'm going to be bringing,  not I'm going to be bringing,  its an applicant that' s bringing a project next month that we' ve been working on for four years,  I mentioned to you before.  If we think a little bit outside the box. This one will cost us money,  but if you think outside the box, there' s opportunities to get partnerships with developers,  landowners,  people who have a vested interest in the city to really do some great things. This is something just to think about for the future,  put it away.  I don' t even want to spend the money on conceptual,  park layout, traffic study, because money is so tight right now that it's not even worth doing it, because it' s not feasible,  not feasible.  Thank you. Hermes,  I appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Manager,  I appreciate you working on that.
