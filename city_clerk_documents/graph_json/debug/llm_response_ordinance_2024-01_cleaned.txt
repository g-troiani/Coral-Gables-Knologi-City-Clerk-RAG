Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the provided ordinance document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the format like E-2 or F-10, etc. If there's none, return NOT_FOUND.

First, I'll start by scanning the entire text provided. The document is Ordinance No. 2024-01 from Coral Gables. Let me read through each section carefully.

Looking at the first page, there's a lot of "WHEREAS" clauses and sections about amending the security district. I don't see an agenda item code there. The second page has the sections 1 through 5, then mentions the passage date and votes. 

Wait, near the end of the second page, after the vote details, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-1)". That looks like the code they're asking for. Let me check again to make sure I'm not missing anything else. The line is right before the mayor's approval and the clerk's signature. The format matches the examples given (like E-1). 

I should confirm there's no other agenda item code mentioned elsewhere. Scanning again through the document, the rest are references to ordinance numbers, resolutions, and sections, but no other agenda item codes. So the correct code here is E-1.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-1
