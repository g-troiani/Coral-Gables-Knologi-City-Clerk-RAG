Because if you' re going to continue to grow,  and like you mentioned in other schools,  they don' t have the parking.   They don' t have the parking if they' re going to grow.  If they' re going to grow.  They haven' t told me they' re going to grow.   I don' t know anything about that.   But you' re making a statement that, obviously,  their plan is to continue to move --  to grow their footprint.\n\nMr. Toyos:   How many single-family homes are you going to keep on taking down?\n\nMayor Lago:   Again,  and I understand that,  but I just wanted to put it on the record that we' re going to have to find some sort of solution,  and the solution' s not going to make everybody happy.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Well, I think a parking lot there,  a structured -Mayor,  I think that you' re going to definitely get the neighbors…\n\nMayor Lago:   I'm just thinking --  and guess what, it's not going to happen.   Okay, but then let me tell you, then what do we do?  We' re going to park people,  let' s say,  at the Biltmore,  you know, and bring them in?\n\nMr. Toyos:  That' s --  you see,  you see, that --  this is where --  that' s not what we signed on for.\n\nMayor Lago:   I understand.\n\nMr. Toyos:  And let me tell you something.   They' re the ones who are expanding.   It' s not us.  We haven' t broken the covenant.   They have.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.  Well, we don' t know if they broke the covenant or not, so let' s be very careful what we say here because,  at the end of the day, we' re under --  we' re all…\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to --?\n\nMayor Lago:   We' re here…\n\nMr. Toyos:   Are they allowed to knock down this house according to the covenant?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   They are allowed to.   That' s my understanding. But again,  we deal with this, we deal with this with a lot of other schools that come before us.  For example,  Gulliver came before us in regards to an expansion of their footprint and they have to provide documents on a continual basis to show how many people are actually enrolled in the school.   A lot of schools have these covenants in place to show that they' re following the rules.   This is nothing new.   So, I have to look into that with the City Manager and my colleagues will do the same thing.   They' ll look at that with the City Manager and with Ms. Russo.   We' ll look at the documents to make sure that they' re adhering to the documents that must be submitted as per their agreement. If we' re not going to talk about expansion today,  that' s something that we' re going to talk about in the future, fine.   But I just want to put on the record,  there has to be --  a solution has to be found in the neighborhood,  because obviously,  this is not working.   And if the swale,  the Planning and Zoning Board is asking for cooperation from your client to put together some sort of swale package,  I want my -- I want input from my colleagues to see what do you think is the best opportunity,  and I know that Ms. Russo wants to respond,  so I'd like to hear from her first really quickly before we open up the (INAUDIBLE).   But we' ve got to find an answer here because it can' t be no swale package, then the only option that we have is we' ve got to get a public safety aide to basically be parked there,  you know, when school drop-off and pick up to make sure that nobody is encroaching or blocking the driveways.   Because,  by the way, we' ve dealt with this before.   We' ve dealt with it at Sunset.   We had multiple meetings on the ground.   I mean,  we had irate neighbors who were telling us, listen,  I couldn' t get out of my driveway for 45 minutes.   People were so desperate to avoid the line on Sunset that they would park their cars,  and then what ended up happening was, you know, I had to wait 45 minutes to go to work or to a doctor' s appointment because I couldn' t get out.  And this is nothing new\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_15bb8999ac6fdb277d9b46ad5d27935b7346f9b5501c12c68bb8e491c0551a14_v2"}
