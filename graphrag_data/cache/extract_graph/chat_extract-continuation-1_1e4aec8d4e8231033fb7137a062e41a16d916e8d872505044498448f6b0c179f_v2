This section 78-281 shall be applicable to the following uses:( 1)Except for rehabilitation of structures of less than 50 percent of value,  all new\n\nconstruction and utility and communications installations shall be required to be underground.( 2)When a structure undergoes a rehabilitation wherein the cost of the rehabilitation is 50 percent or more of the replacement value of the existing structure as determined by the Miami- Dade County Property Appraiser, utility and communications service facilities for that structure shall be converted from overhead to underground.\n\nc)Conversion of overhead to underground facilities.  Whenever overhead utility lines or distribution facilities have been converted to underground facilities,  the following shall be required:(1)The property owners in the area to be served by the new facilities shall be required to arrange for the conversion of their existing service facilities in accordance with these regulations and, where applicable, utility company specifications for underground service. For electric service facilities, such conversion shall include but shall not be limited to rearranging existing electric drop and service entrance facilities and necessary facilities within buildings and structures to accommodate the undergrounding of utilities. The property owner shall be responsible for all costs associated with the modification of service facilities for the affected property to accommodate underground utility service to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law and if not otherwise paid by the utility company.( 2)When a pole owner engages in undergrounding its facilities and equipment that will result in a redundant pole,  the pole owner shall be required to provide notice to attaching entities and to the city. Attaching entities shall be required to underground their facilities and equipment or remove all attachments from a redundant pole in coordination with the pole owner.  The city may,  at its discretion but without obligation of any kind,  provide a courtesy notice to the attaching entity of the planned or intended overhead to underground conversion project being performed or affecting any area of the city rendering the pole unused for electrical distribution purposes. Failure by any attaching entity to remove pole attachments shall constitute a code enforcement violation under section 101-137 of this Code. Fines shall accrue on a per pole basis,  and shall continue to accrue, as applicable, for each day the violation continues past the date set for compliance. Failure by an attaching entity to comply with this section shall constitute grounds for the city to deny issuance of future permits pursuant to this Article until compliance is obtained.(3)Redundant poles serving any area or property must be removed by the pole owner within 90 days of the conversion of overhead facilities to underground serving said area or property. Failure to remove redundant poles shall constitute a code enforcement violation under this Code.  Civil penalties shall accrue on a per pole basis, and shall continue to accrue, as applicable, for each day the violation continues past the date set for compliance. Failure by a pole owner to comply with this section shall constitute grounds for the city to deny issuance of future permits pursuant to this article until compliance is obtained.( 4)In the event a pole owner or electric utility,  as defined in this section,  conveys,  sells,  or transfers a pole located in a private easement granted by the city or property belonging to the city to an attaching entity, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law or ordinances or resolutions of the city, the attaching entity shall be responsible for payments to the city for continued use of the private easement or property.( 5)In the event a pole owner is engaging in a major hardening project as provided in F.S. ยง  366. 97, the procedures for redundant poles contained in F.S. ยง  366.97,  as it may be amended,  and orders of the Florida Public Service Commission shall apply and shall control in the event of a conflict with the procedures contained in this section. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the pole owner shall provide\n\nthe city with copies of notices issued to attaching entities. The city may, in its discretion, issue orders consistent with such procedures contained in F.S. ยง 366.97,  and orders of the Florida Public Service Commission to address the removal of redundant poles.  Failure to comply with such city orders shall constitute a code enforcement violation under section 101- 137 of this Code.  Civil penalties may accrue on a per pole basis,  and shall continue to accrue,  as applicable, for each day the violation continues past the date set for compliance. In addition to other remedies provided in this section or available to the city pursuant to applicable law, failure by an attaching entity or pole owner to comply with this section shall constitute grounds for the city to deny issuance of permits pursuant to this article until compliance is obtained.(6)Notwithstanding any requirements set forth in this Code or the Coral Gables Zoning Code,  the installation of above ground appurtenances and facilities in connection with an undergrounding project may be subject solely to administrative review if all of the following criteria are satisfied\n\n- a.The location of the proposed facilities are within appropriate utility easements;\n\nb.The proposed facilities will not interfere with any utility, communications,  water or sewer service or with the reasonable ingress, egress or use of the property;\n\n- c.No more than two facilities are installed on any particular property or parcel, provided that the city manager or designee is authorized to reject the placement of multiple facilities and to gran t reasonable exceptions to these limits.\n- d)Notice of conversion requirement. The city shall notify each property owner when conversion from overhead to underground utility distribution service is complete.  The notice shall be served by registered mail, addressed to the owner or owners of the property described as they are known to the city manager or as their names and addresses are shown upon the records of the county tax assessor,  or other public records of the city or county,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SECTION
