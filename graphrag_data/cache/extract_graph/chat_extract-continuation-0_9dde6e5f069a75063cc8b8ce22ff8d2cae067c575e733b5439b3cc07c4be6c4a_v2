They' re blocking our driveways.   Yeah,  I mean,  and this happens,  how do you call it, constantly. And I keep on hearing it's the Salvadore Park, people who come to Salvadore Park,  the dog park, the pickleballers.   I don' t see people with pickleball rackets coming down, you know, blocking our driveways or doing that.  We' re trying to just keep our swales like any normal one.  Yes, we have normal use of swale,  delivery guys,  postal service,  whatever. But at least with that,  we could maintain our grass.   We can' t maintain our grass.   Their side looks like a desert,  okay, on Cordova side.\n\nMs. Toyos:  ( INAUDIBLE)  the pictures?\n\nMr.  Toyos: One of our neighbors behind them has had his swale with,  how do you call it, landscaping now for, as long as I can remember.   You know, we' ve owned that property for over 20 years. They' ve had it for much more than that,  so they' ve dealt with it.   Our backdoor neighbors,  Mary and --  this is what it looks like.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is what the neighbors do to our sidewalks.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And this is what the other neighbors have to do to make sure that they don' t block them when the pickup and drop-off (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is barricades put up by, I guess,  the City.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:   The signs are being used to help the --  the signs alone are not enough.   This is what they' ve used to keep the people off the corner so that the intersection visibility doesn' t get blocked.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Toyos:   Sometimes I can' t get out of my house because people are blocking my entrance and exit.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Backdoor neighbor,  she had to put it because her driveway' s in the front, so Andalusia, corner of Andalusia,  and right behind us,  and -on Cordova,  they had to put landscape in their front.  Now their side is still barren.   They can' t do anything.   It's --  I mean,  we can' t maintain our grass.   And it's not the people using the dog park.   It's not the people using the pickleball courts or tennis courts.  It's parents.   And we reached out to the pastor,  with all due respect,  in 2022.  We went in and we sat with her.  Nothing' s come from it.  Nothing.   The Planning and Zoning asked them,  hey, reach out to the neighbor.   Just try to take care of their situation.\n\nMs. Toyos:   They didn' t reach out.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Nothing.   We' ve tried to be neighborly. And to say that we' re not --  asking is not neighborly,  no, it was the Planning and Zoning Board.   All of them agreed that, hey, this is on you guys.   This is not on them.   So, we just want a solution,  but we also want to know --  there' s two issues here.   They bought that house in 2016 and now has an exemption.   So, they' re paying $ 67. So, I imagine that they' re having a school and it says an educational exemption on that property in the corner right across from us.  And by the way, we' re only 130 feet.  We might not be adjacent, but our radius,  we' re 130 feet from their closest property line, their campus property line.  So,  if they' re there and they' re claiming that exemption,  what' s the use of this property?   Because this is what' s causing the issues. If they' re going to keep on buying single- family homes and converting them over into school space,  it defeats the purpose.   They have no parking.   They have zero parking.   This should have been done with 30, 40 years ago when they expanded or they did this amendment and all that stuff.  This should have taken place because they just didn' t have the parking.   This is a -- they have unique circumstances than other schools,  okay?  St. Teresa,  Ponce, Coral Gables,  all those schools,  they have parking.   They don' t have parking.   They do not have parking.  So, we need to come up with a solution,  okay, where they actively patrol or do something, but they' re not doing that.   But then we also need to know,  what are their future plans?   Are we going to keep on --  they' re one single- family home away from owning all of Coral Way,  okay, Orlando' s home and the one that they bought here.   And that' s it, we' re done.   So,  what is the future plans here?  And what are we going to do about the parking?  Because yeah,  we do want it addressed. We don' t want our parking -our driveways blocked,  and we don' t want our grass dead.
