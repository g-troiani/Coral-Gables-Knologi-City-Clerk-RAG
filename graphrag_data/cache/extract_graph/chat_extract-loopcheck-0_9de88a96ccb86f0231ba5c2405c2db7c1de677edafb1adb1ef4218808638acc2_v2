Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

So, I did see live oaks out in El Paso when I was there, so I don' t know if its really necessarily the heat level or the lack of a freeze,  I guess some research that someone would\n\nhave to do on whether or not they need a freeze,  but I know that that' s true with many other varieties of trees and why we can' t grow Sycamores down here and so forth.  It's not because it doesn' t get hot elsewhere.  It was 102 degrees in Chicago one year.  It's not the heat so much,  its does that tree require a freeze and where is it planted.  So, it was a brutal summer.  My kids wanted to go shopping.  Is it air-conditioned was the only question I kept asking them.  So,  yes,  looking forward to the trees getting planted.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  So, what I would like to see done is just have a conversation with Dr. Feely and report back to us on what recommendations he would have.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn: Absolutely. I'm familiar with Dr.  Feely' s research. Our arborist,  our senior arborist and I have looked into it. We' ve read his articles.\n\nMayor Lago:  You' ve already incorporated some of his guidance,  right.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Yes. So basically,  just in a nutshell,  I don' t want to take too much time, but this concern is due to climate change.  Any tropical tree species migrating up to different areas and as we have a heat change in temperature,  he was concerned live oaks might migrate further north,  because they are not a tropical species.  But in our tree succession planning and here' s our list,  and also,  we had zoning code changes this year,  it encourages more tree diversity and we' re following a lot more tree diversity and here' s the list if anyone' s interested, but you can see a big variety of different natives,  flowering trees with a few oaks,  because oaks are still very viable today.  They are the most sustainable tree.  Our senior arborist stands by them. They are so resilient in hurricanes.  You can see the longevity of them in urban areas. Look at Coral Way,  they' ve been here 80-100 years.  Today,  they are still viable and so,  the concept of what' s going to happen in the future because of unknown climate change is good research to be familiar with, there are so many different opinions on it. So that' s where we are.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I appreciate it.\n\nGreenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn:  Sure.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a city commissioner who requested a conversation with Dr. Feely and a report on his recommendations regarding tree planting and climate change impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Dr. Feely<|>PERSON<|>Dr. Feely, a researcher whose work on tree species migration and climate change has been reviewed by the city's arborists and referenced in discussions about tree planting and diversity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn<|>PERSON<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn, the city's greenspace director who is familiar with Dr. Feely's research, has consulted with the senior arborist, and provided information on tree diversity, climate change concerns, and tree succession planning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the mayor who inquired about the incorporation of Dr. Feely's guidance into city planning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Tree Succession Planning<|>PROJECT<|>Tree succession planning project that includes a list of diverse native and flowering trees, with a focus on sustainable species like oaks, aimed at addressing climate change and promoting tree diversity in the city.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Dr. Feely<|>Commissioner Fernandez requested a conversation with Dr. Feely and a report on his recommendations, indicating a direct request for expert input.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn<|>Dr. Feely<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn is familiar with Dr. Feely's research and has reviewed his articles with the senior arborist, showing direct consultation and reliance on his work.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn<|>Mayor Lago asked if Dr. Feely's guidance had already been incorporated, indicating a direct inquiry about the implementation status.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn<|>Tree Succession Planning<|>Greenspace Director Bell-Llewelyn described the tree succession planning project, including the list of tree species and zoning code changes encouraging diversity.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Tree Succession Planning<|>Dr. Feely<|>The project considers concerns raised by Dr. Feely about tree species migration due to climate change, linking his research to the planning efforts.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
