It establishes substantive provisions that guide zoning practices and land development, ensuring orderly growth and compliance with local standards. The Zoning Code's centrality is underscored by its high degree of connectivity to other entities such as Density Limitation, Parking Requirement, and Open Space Requirement, which are all components embedded within the code. This central role makes the Zoning Code a critical instrument for city planners, developers, and regulatory authorities in managing urban development and maintaining community standards [Data: Entities (154); Relationships (127, 1765, 1766, 1768)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Recent amendments enhance regulatory clarity and efficiency\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Ordinance 23-6828 and Ordinance No. 2024-03 represent significant recent amendments to the Zoning Code.
