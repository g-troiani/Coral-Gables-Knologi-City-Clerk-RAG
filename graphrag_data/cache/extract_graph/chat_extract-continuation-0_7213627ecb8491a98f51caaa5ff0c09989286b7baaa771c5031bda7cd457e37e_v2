I'm going to be walking in an area that I want to be in.  I'm very particular because I like to walk to my office.  So, you know, that' s how sensitive some of these issues are. Or you want to be near a different type of business because you don' t want to have too many restaurants next to each other.   You want to go walk that area and see how many restaurants are there.  Is there a clothing store there?  Is the clothing store wanting to be near the restaurant because the traffic that goes to the restaurant is going to be browsing then the clothing and going and buying that.   So,  the walkability of the area and the parking,  et cetera,  is a critical,  critical issue.

I think staff has examples of what one is. No, just if you want to go up there so everybody can see the difference in size.   Because I was trying to size up a TV, you know.  Thank you, I appreciate it.   It' s good to know.  Sometimes it' s important to have visuals.   You did very good, you can do Wheel of Fortune one day.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   It's excellent,  great idea.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Vanna White.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, Belkys.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I spoke to a few folks in the commercial real estate industry.   That was a pretty good line.   And they made a comment,  a thought that,  and it probably holds true.   First off, what department in the City is tasked with making sure signage is the right size?  Do we have a --?\n\nCity Attorney\n\nSuÆrez:  Code --  that would be Code Enforcement,  sir.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   It would be Code Enforcement.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   It would be a Code Enforcement violation to violate our sign ordinance.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Because one thought was that it's possible that folks are putting signs actually bigger than what is allowed.   And if that' s the case,  we may first want to make sure -have Code Enforcement spend a couple of months trying to see how many businesses are using signage above and beyond what' s already allowed.   Because what I'm hearing is the folks in the industry want to keep it as is.  They' re not saying let' s go bigger.   But if some are going bigger, they' re tainting the businesses or the reputation of what' s happening by those that are abiding by the law.  So, my preference would be to see --  have Code Enforcement see what they can find out in terms of are folks actually going above and beyond what' s allowed.  If that' s the case, why don' t we crack down on those individuals and then come back and see if that perhaps helped the situation that,  you know, perhaps is out there.   That' s my take.   Thank you.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Commissioner,  we' ll be happy to have Code Enforcement look at it, and they do enforce it when it's --  basically,  the residential is 4 by 10…\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   And the commercial is 16 by 16 inches or just a hair below that.  And they should be enforcing that,  but we' ll make an issue and we' ll…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   The fact that it's now a discussion publicly,  you know, we all -- Code Enforcement,  we all handle a million things.  And sometimes it' s --  you know, we shine a light on an issue.   Let' s focus on that issue and see what we come up with.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner,  do you have any comments?\n\nCommissioner Castro: Yes,  I wouldn' t be opposed to giving them a little more time for some community input on your Real Estate Committee as well.  And then I guess we could take it from there.\n\nMayor Lago:   So, I just want to talk a few points on this ordinance.   First, I'd like to have Belkys come up for a second so we can kind of compare when we talk about the wrap ordinance.   I know I didn' t ask you to do this before,  I just kind of found out about this ordinance on Friday,  so we really didn' t have much time to really go over it, and I thought about it over the weekend.   I didn' t want to bother you over the weekend. So,  when we talked about the wrap ordinance that I sponsored in 2022,  how long did we work on that,  how much input did we garner from the community?   Because we transformed wraps,  the wraps that we…\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   Right, yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   Put on the businesses now.  How did we do that?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:   It was a process.\n\nMayor Lago:   To the best that you remember.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I would say probably two to three months that we worked\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City Commission of Coral Gables, involved in discussions and decisions regarding city matters such as signage enforcement and ordinances.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where various city issues including signage enforcement and ordinances were discussed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding officer at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, who led discussions on signage and wrap ordinances.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER_MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, participant in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting, who raised concerns about signage size enforcement and suggested Code Enforcement investigate possible violations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE_MAYOR_ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, participant in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting, who complimented the presentation regarding signage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER_CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, participant in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting, who supported allowing more time for community input on signage issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_ATTORNEY_SUAREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Suárez, who clarified that Code Enforcement is responsible for enforcing sign ordinance violations during the January 9, 2024 meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Iglesias, who confirmed that Code Enforcement enforces signage size limits and agreed to have them investigate potential violations during the January 9, 2024 meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CODE_ENFORCEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Code Enforcement department of the City of Coral Gables, responsible for enforcing the sign ordinance and investigating violations as discussed in the January 9, 2024 meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTOR_PEREZ<|>PERSON<|>Economic Development Director Perez, who participated in the January 9, 2024 meeting and discussed the process of implementing the wrap ordinance sponsored in 2022.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>The City Commission convened the meeting on January 9, 2024, to discuss city issues including signage enforcement.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Mayor Lago presided over the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER_MENENDEZ<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Commissioner Menendez actively participated in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting discussing signage enforcement.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICE_MAYOR_ANDERSON<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Vice Mayor Anderson contributed to the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER_CASTRO<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Commissioner Castro participated in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting and supported more community input.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_ATTORNEY_SUAREZ<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>City Attorney Suárez provided legal clarification during the January 9, 2024 meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_IGLESIAS<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>City Manager Iglesias spoke about Code Enforcement responsibilities during the January 9, 2024 meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CODE_ENFORCEMENT<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Code Enforcement's role and enforcement actions were discussed in the January 9, 2024 meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTOR_PEREZ<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>Economic Development Director Perez participated in the January 9, 2024 meeting discussing the wrap ordinance.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER_MENENDEZ<|>CODE_ENFORCEMENT<|>Commissioner Menendez requested Code Enforcement to investigate signage violations as discussed in the January 9, 2024 meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_ATTORNEY_SUAREZ<|>CODE_ENFORCEMENT<|>City Attorney Suárez identified Code Enforcement as responsible for enforcing sign ordinance violations.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_IGLESIAS<|>CODE_ENFORCEMENT<|>City Manager Iglesias confirmed Code Enforcement enforces signage size limits.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTOR_PEREZ<|>Mayor Lago asked Economic Development Director Perez about the process of the 2022 wrap ordinance.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
