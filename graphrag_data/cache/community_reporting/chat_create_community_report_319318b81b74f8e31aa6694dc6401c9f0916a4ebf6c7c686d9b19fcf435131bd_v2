This amendment authorizes the replacement of an existing building with a new pre-K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables. All other conditions of approval contained in the original Ordinance No. 3576 remain in full effect. This amendment was recommended for approval with conditions by the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) on November 3, 2023, with a unanimous 7-0 vote. The ordinance was discussed at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, and includes provisions for an effective date.\n\nThe second ordinance, referenced by document number 23-6566, involves the approval of a Planned Area Development (PAD) pursuant to Zoning Code Article 14, Section 14-206, for a proposed Publix grocery store and liquor store. This development is planned for the property legally described as Lots 1 through 48, Block 8, Coral Gables Crafts Section, located at 2551 Le Jeune Road, Coral Gables, Florida. The ordinance includes required conditions, a repealer provision, a severability clause, and an effective date. The PZB recommended this ordinance for approval with conditions on November 8, 2023, with a vote of 5-1. The lobbyist associated with this item is Mario Garcia-Serra. This ordinance was also linked to a Time Certain meeting at 2:00 pm and connected to Agenda Item E-11.\n\nIn summary, Agenda Item E-4 encompasses two separate City Commission ordinances in Coral Gables: one amending the St. Philip's School site plan to replace an existing building with a new pre-K facility at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, maintaining all prior conditions of approval; and another approving a Planned Area Development for a Publix grocery and liquor store at 2551 Le Jeune Road, including all necessary legal provisions and conditions.

These conditions were designed to address site-specific considerations and ensure compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nThe ordinance has since been amended by Agenda Item E-4 to allow the replacement of an existing building on the site with a new pre-kindergarten (pre-K) building. Despite this amendment, all other conditions of approval set forth in Ordinance No. 3576 remain in full effect. The amendment specifically modifies the original site plan to accommodate the new pre-K building while maintaining the integrity of the other established requirements.\n\nIn summary, Ordinance No. 3576 continues to govern the development and site conditions of St. Philip's School, with the sole modification being the replacement of an existing structure with a new pre-K building as authorized by Agenda Item E-4.
