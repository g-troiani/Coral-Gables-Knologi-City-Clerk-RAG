According to Garcia, certain amendments to the code, for example related to bus stops, may not be necessary if those stops are eliminated, as the ordinance criteria remain unchanged.\n\nWhile the zoning code generally governs land use and development activities, it does not impose binding restrictions on the City of Coral Gables regarding the construction, modification, or operation of certain city facilities, which are explicitly enumerated within the code. Additionally, some zoning regulations are preempted by state legislation, notably the Live Local Act, which affects developments that comply with the Act’s provisions.\n\nThe City also applies the zoning code in the context of Government Settlements, ensuring that land use approvals and compliance are consistent with legal agreements and regulatory requirements.
