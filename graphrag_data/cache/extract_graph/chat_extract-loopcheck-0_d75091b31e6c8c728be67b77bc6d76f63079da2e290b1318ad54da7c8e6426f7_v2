Mr.  Mayor,  Vice Mayor,  the Commissioners, thank you for allowing me to stay here today and give you the opinion of the business community as through the lens of the Chamber.   As you know, the Chamber only became aware of this ordinance late Friday. It has significantly hampered our ability to speak to our members and see how it' s going to affect their businesses. These include companies like the Allen Morris Company,  Terranova,  Davis &amp; Young,  as well as the Miami Association of Realtors,  the Commercial Alliance.   We believe we have previously addressed this issue for available retail space in our downtown area when we worked together with you over a year ago on the window wrap ordinance for leasable space.   That took into account the signage for the brokerage and the property owners as well.   We have also learned that the commercial brokers are required to list specific information on their signs,  and by reducing the signage from the 250 to the 40 is going to hamper their ability to stay in compliance with the DBPR.   Finally,  even in this day and age of leasing and selling commercial properties, it' s critical that available space be advertised in the window,  especially ground floor retail space. We spoke with our City consultant,  Midge McCauley,  who reiterated this need and the fact that the 250 square feet inches on these signs are small,  less obtrusive than you might see in other municipalities.   We would simply ask for more time to present to our Real Estate Committee and to our business members what the Commission is proposing and allow us to look at the pros and cons and work together to find a solution that would work for the City.  Of course,  we want the City to maintain and continue to be beautiful,  but we' d also like to make sure that we' re not impacting the economic engine,  which is the business community.   Thank you so much for your time, for listening to me, and for your consideration.   Thank you.\n\nCommissioner\n\nCastro:   Thank you.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-8 - Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables official Zoning Code,  amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107 ' Real Estate,  For Sale, Lease or Rental of Property or Buildings,' to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease, or rental of property or buildings in any use district.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Manny Chamizo.\n\nMayor Lago:   Good morning,  sir.\n\nManny Chamizo:   Good morning.  Echoing --  good morning, Commissioner,  Mr. Mayor.  Echoing my oldest friend...\n\nMayor Lago:   Can you put your name and address on the record?\n\nMr. Chamizo:   Sure,  Manny Chamizo,  1507 Sunset.   My oldest friend,  not because I'm old, it's because we' ve been friends since second grade.   Great,  great presentation.   Echoing exactly what Sarah had mentioned,  for me, it's --  sign pollution is critical.   I get it.  You drive around the City, other cities,  and you see billboards,  eight by 10, huge billboards.   I don' t see that issue here in Coral Gables.  To your point, Commissioner Fernandez,  as a commercial practitioner for 38 years, I can tell you that the signage is important.  It's important to identify the buildings,  especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   I'm not sure who you spoke to.  Most of the dominant players, I know who they are, and not all property is listed on the internet.   Sometimes you have to walk it and see it, especially when it comes to commercial real estate.   It' s not as, fortunately,  it' s not like residential real estate where it's a little bit more specific.   Vehicle count is very important.   Foot traffic is important,  parking is important.   So,  there' s a number of other things.   So,  my biggest question is what' s the specific reason? I mean,  other than the fact that I'm cognizant of the pollution,  I mean,  these signs are 12 by 10, whatever the number of square inches are, and you' re having this reduced to the smaller version or proposing to have it reduced.   I'm wondering with the hundreds and hundreds of other signs that I see that are billboard size signs,  including the wrapping of the outside of these buildings when they' re supposed to be temporary,  but I see them being there permanent,  what' s the\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City Commission, the governing
