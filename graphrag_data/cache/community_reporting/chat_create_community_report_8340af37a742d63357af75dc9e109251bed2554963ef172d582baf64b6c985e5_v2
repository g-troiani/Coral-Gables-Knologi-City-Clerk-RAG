It specifically mandates reductions in parking requirements for affordable housing projects near major transit stops, thereby easing development standards to promote transit-oriented affordable housing. The Act also preempts local height and density limitations within certain mixed-use districts, allowing for greater building heights and density to facilitate housing development. Effective July 1, 2023, the Act represents a significant state-level intervention to support affordable housing initiatives and unlocks access to over $800 million in funding.

Similarly, density limitations, capped at 125 units per acre citywide, are preempted to allow for a citywide analysis that supports affordable housing development.
