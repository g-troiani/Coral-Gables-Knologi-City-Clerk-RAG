This intermediary function is critical in reducing potential conflicts or disturbances that might arise from the proximity of a residential property to an institutional facility. By serving as a buffer, it helps maintain privacy and reduces noise or visual intrusion for the residents of the Existing Home to the East. This role is explicitly described in the relationship where the Storage Buffer acts as a buffer between the two entities [Data: Entities (849, 858); Relationships (1242)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Existing Home to the East is adjacent to the proposed preschool site\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Existing Home to the East is a single-family residential property located immediately east of the proposed preschool building site.

Such buffering is often employed to comply with zoning laws, noise ordinances, and community standards, indicating a degree of legal and regulatory compliance in the development process.
