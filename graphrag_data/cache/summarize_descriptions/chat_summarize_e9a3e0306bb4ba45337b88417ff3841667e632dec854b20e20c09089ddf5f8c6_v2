This department has the authority to issue warnings and enforce penalties to maintain adherence to city ordinances. Among its key responsibilities is the removal of shutters after hurricane season, as well as the enforcement of sign size compliance, a role confirmed by City Attorney Suárez and City Manager Iglesias. Code Enforcement actively investigates violations related to signage size and works to reduce sign pollution throughout the City. The department has been noted for its involvement in removing non-compliant signs, including those on trolleys, and has been accompanied multiple times by Mayor Lago in efforts to eliminate unauthorized signage. While the department is recognized for its enforcement duties, there is an identified need to improve efforts, particularly regarding real estate signs, to ensure full compliance with the sign ordinance under discussion.
