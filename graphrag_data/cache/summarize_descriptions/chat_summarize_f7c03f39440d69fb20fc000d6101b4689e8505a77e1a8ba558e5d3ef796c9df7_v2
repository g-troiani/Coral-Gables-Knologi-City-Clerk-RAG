The ordinance, identified as Ordinance No. 2024-03 (also referenced as Ordinance 23-6786 and document number 23-6827), was passed and adopted unanimously by the City Commission on January 9, 2024, and further considered by the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) on February 20, 2024.\n\nKey amendments include the addition of a definition of “publication” and the removal of the requirement for newspaper publication of legal notices, thereby permitting online publication as an acceptable method. This change modernizes the City’s legal notice procedures and aligns with current practices, ensuring greater accessibility and efficiency. The ordinance also introduces Section 5-314, titled “Window and Hurricane Shutters,” which regulates the closure of window and hurricane shutters, including penalties for closures outside of hurricane season as outlined in amendments to Chapter 1-General Provisions, Section 1-7 “Penalties.”\n\nAdditionally, the ordinance amends Article 1, Section 1-104 “Jurisdiction and Applicability” to incorporate provisions for the siting of city facilities for workforce housing that are owned, financed, or operated by the City, County, or other public governmental entities. This amendment complies with Miami-Dade County Code Section 33-193.7 and supports the development and management of public workforce housing within Coral Gables.\n\nThe ordinance includes standard legislative provisions such as a repealer clause, severability clause, codification, and an effective date to ensure proper implementation and legal clarity. The PZB reviewed the ordinance in two separate votes on February 20, 2024, with a 5-0 vote supporting the window shutter regulations and a narrower 3-2 vote on the workforce housing siting provisions. The ordinance was sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez and reflects the City’s ongoing efforts to update zoning regulations to meet contemporary needs and legal standards.\n\nIn summary, Agenda Item E-3 represents a comprehensive update to the Coral Gables Zoning Code that modernizes legal notice publication, regulates hurricane shutter use, and facilitates public workforce housing development, thereby enhancing the City’s regulatory framework and responsiveness to community and governmental requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844107, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 494, "prompt_tokens": 899, "total_tokens": 1393, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
