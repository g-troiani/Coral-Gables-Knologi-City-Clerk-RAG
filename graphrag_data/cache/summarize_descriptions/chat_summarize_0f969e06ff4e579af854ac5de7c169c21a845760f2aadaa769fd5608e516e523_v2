These hearings provide an opportunity for public input and ensure transparency in municipal decision-making.\n\nNotice requirements for PUBLIC HEARINGS are stringent to guarantee adequate public awareness and participation. Typically, a notice must be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten to fifteen days prior to the hearing date. In many cases, courtesy notices are also mailed to nearby or riparian property owners within 1,000 feet of the proposed work or affected property. Additionally, signs may be posted on the property involved to further inform the public.\n\nBefore the City Commission approves or disapproves an application or request, such as permits or zoning changes, the matter is often investigated and recommended upon by relevant city departments, such as the Public Works Department. The public hearing then serves as a platform for stakeholders, including affected property owners and other interested parties, to express their views and concerns.\n\nOverall, PUBLIC HEARINGS are essential components of the cityâ€™s governance process, ensuring that decisions regarding land use, infrastructure projects, environmental permits, and municipal fees are made with public knowledge and input, following legally mandated notice procedures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840829, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 491, "total_tokens": 794, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
