These entities collectively manage local governance, zoning and land use amendments, historic preservation, infrastructure, and community development.\n\nCoral Gables is currently undergoing several zoning and land use changes, including the approval of ordinances related to the vacation of public alleyways and the development of projects such as the Ponce Park Residences and a planned Publix grocery and liquor store. The city also manages city-owned real property and enacts resolutions to support these developments and other municipal initiatives.\n\nThe city hosts numerous government facilities and services, including the Police Department, municipal fire department, emergency services, and educational institutions such as St. Philip's School and Coral Gables Senior High School. The City Commission operates from premises including the notable address at 290 Miracle Mile, serving as the hub for legislative and administrative functions.\n\nCoral Gables actively engages in community recognition and cultural observances, having declared March 21, 2024, as \"Michael Turbeville Day\" and March 2024 as Women's History Month through formal proclamations. The city also honors public servants by awarding distinctions such as the Firefighter of the Year Award.\n\nThe cityâ€™s government maintains transparency and accessibility through its legislative gateway and online platforms, including coralgables.legistar.com, where agendas, meeting documents, and updates on programs like the Uber Pilot Program and tree canopy replacement initiatives are available. Coral Gables also manages special elections and annexation processes, such as those involving the Little Gables area.\n\nOverall, Coral Gables is a vibrant city with a comprehensive municipal structure that supports community development, historic preservation, public safety, and civic engagement, making it a well-governed and dynamic part of the Miami-Dade region.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749145729, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 438, "prompt_tokens": 1226, "total_tokens": 1664, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
