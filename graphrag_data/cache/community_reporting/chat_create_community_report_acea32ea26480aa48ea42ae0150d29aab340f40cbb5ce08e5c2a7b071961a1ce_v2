The Board's role extends beyond regulatory review to addressing neighborhood concerns, infrastructure improvements, and aesthetic considerations. For example, it has actively advocated for swale improvements and imposed conditions on development projects to maintain community character, such as requiring window operability restrictions and landscaping mandates.

After its review, the board forwards its recommendations to the City Commission for final decisions.\n\nThe board is actively involved in addressing neighborhood concerns and improving community infrastructure. For example, it requested cooperation from a client to develop a swale package aimed at mitigating issues related to St. Philip's School. Additionally, in November, the Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval of a major amendment while also advocating for the expansion of swale improvements along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia. These efforts demonstrate the board’s commitment to enhancing neighborhood landscaping and stormwater management.\n\nBeyond infrastructure, the board also influences decisions related to parking and neighborhood aesthetics. It has been a stakeholder in discussions concerning site plan amendments and parking solutions, such as those related to Agenda Item E-4. In one instance, the board recommended approval of a project with three specific conditions: ensuring window operability, maintaining existing conditions including child limits, and landscaping the front of the building. This highlights the board’s attention to both functional and community-oriented aspects of development projects.\n\nFurthermore, the Planning and Zoning Board serves as the body to which City staff report following the approval of a Zoning in Progress Resolution moratorium.
