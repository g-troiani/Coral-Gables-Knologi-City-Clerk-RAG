The Commission Meetings are characterized by lengthy presentations and protocol sections, which have prompted proposals for separate recognition ceremonies to better honor employees and reduce meeting durations.

However, these meetings often extend up to an hour and forty-five minutes or more, largely due to the time allocated to presentations and protocol sections. This extended duration has impacted the time available for addressing residents' concerns, indicating a challenge in balancing procedural requirements with community engagement. The protocol section alone can last up to two hours, further contributing to the length of meetings.
