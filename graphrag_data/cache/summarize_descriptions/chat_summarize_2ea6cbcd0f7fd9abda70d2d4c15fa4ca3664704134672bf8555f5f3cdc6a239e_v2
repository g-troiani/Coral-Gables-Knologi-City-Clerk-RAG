First, it proposes text amendments to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code, specifically amending Article 10, \"Parking and Access,\" Section 10-112, \"Miscellaneous Parking Standards.\" These amendments aim to establish provisions for reducing parking requirements for affordable housing developments located near major transit stops, in compliance with the Live Local Act, Chapter 2023-17, Laws of Florida. This part of the ordinance includes standard legislative elements such as a repealer provision, severability clause, codification, and an effective date.\n\nSecond, Agenda Item E-5 involves an amendment to the Future Land Use Map of the City of Coral Gables Comprehensive Plan pursuant to Zoning Code Article 14, Section 14-213, and the Small Scale amendment procedures under Florida Statutes section 163.3187. This amendment seeks to change the land use designation from \"Commercial Low-Rise Intensity\" to \"Commercial High-Rise Intensity\" for specific properties located in the Crafts Section, specifically Lots 8 through 21 (excluding the west half of Lot 8) of Block 29, including part of the 20-foot platted alley east of Lots 11 and 19. The affected addresses include 3000 Ponce de Leon Blvd, 216 & 224 Catalonia, 203 University Dr, and 225 Malaga, Coral Gables, Florida. The ordinance includes a repealer provision, severability clause, and effective date, with the legal description on file.\n\nThe proposed land use amendment was reviewed by the Local Planning Agency (LPA) and the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB), which recommended denial of the amendment on December 13, 2023, with a tied vote of 3-3. The ordinance is identified by document numbers 23-6704 and 23-6826 in official records. Lobbyist Javier Fernandez was noted as representing interests related to this item.\n\nIn summary, Agenda Item E-5 encompasses both a zoning text amendment to facilitate reduced parking requirements for affordable housing near transit stops, as mandated by state law, and a proposed but contested amendment to increase allowable commercial building intensity in a defined area of Coral Gables. The item includes all necessary legislative provisions such as repealer and severability clauses and awaits further action following mixed recommendations from advisory boards.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844107, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 501, "prompt_tokens": 872, "total_tokens": 1373, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
