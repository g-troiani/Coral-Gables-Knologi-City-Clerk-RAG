Another example,  a two-bedroom would be just over $2,700. So, the Live Local Act also automatically approves height through the highest height within one mile. As you know, we have three zoning districts, MX1, 2, and 3, and that limits the heights.  However,  it's preempted that they will have the highest height within one mile. So, these are maps that our amazing GIS team provided for us and it's showing a radius from those MX2 and MX3 districts. MX2 district is a 70-foot height limitation that' s shown in the bluish/ gray color and 150 is the MX3 maximum height,  which is shown in the greenish color.  And then the density is also preempted by the state to be analyzed citywide.  So,  while the height is analyzed within one mile of the development,  the density is analyzed citywide maximum.  So, the maximum density in our city is 125 units an acre,  as our density is calculated by units per acre and the maximum is 125. So, we do have areas in our city that allow for a limited density that is our Central Business District and our Design and Innovation District, and if an affordable housing development would develop in those areas,  they would be allowed to have also a limited density, but not outside.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  If I may, just as a refresher.  There may be a limited density,  but you' re still required to have a limit in regard to the size of the unit, correct.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, all those…\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s kind of your bookend.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes.  So,  all those zoning parameters such as FAR,  maximum,  open space…\n\nMayor Lago: You are mentioning limited density and people think, oh my God, you give thousands of units in one building.  You can' t because you end up eating away at the square footage because you have a cap on a minimum size of a unit size.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  And parking.\n\nMayor Lago:  And parking,  so you keep going higher and the higher you go you meet the parking requirement,  the parking pedestals eat away.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  So,  the FAR,  the floor area ratio is very important to control how the scale of that development,  because 3.5 FAR, which is our maximum in our mixed- use district is quite limiting when it comes to reaching 190 feet. So, the ACT also preempts the approval process that has to be approved administratively for the density,  the height,  and the land use. So, properties in our zoning code right now, we require a conditional use process for properties that are greater than 20,000 square feet, and now it goes through the Development Review Committee,  the Board of Architects, Planning and Zoning,  and the City Commission. This will also apply for any development that would honor the Live Local Act to go through that process,  but the Commission would consider other zoning code regulations,  such as FAR,  such as open space on the ground level, parking as well, all those other zoning considerations.  The Commission is preempted to have consideration when it comes to use, height,  and density.  And any property that' s less than 20,000 square feet would not require the building peer review process.  It would go through DRC,  our Board of Architects,  and from there go to permitting.  So, in summary,  the preemption is for the use,  the density,  and the height.  The use is for mixed- use districts.  I just went through the map of where those districts are in our urban areas, analyzed citywide and the height is whatever is allowed within one mile of that proposed property.  So,  the legislation before you today is what the Live Local Act is requiring the city to consider and that is a parking reduction within a half-a-mile of the development and the city can define what major transit stop means.  So, the legislation before you is to find major transit stop as a metro station or the intersection of two or more major bus or trolley routes with frequencies of service intervals of 15 minutes or less,  during morning and afternoon peak commute periods. So, taking a look at the better bus network, there have been some improvements to our bus system,  and so this would apply to Flagler, 8th Street, Douglas,  and Coral Way. Those will meet the kind of high frequency bus routes.  This is the map showing half-a-mile\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nfrom those intersecting points and also including the Metrorail stops. You can see it's mostly along our urban areas and then close to the City of South Miami.  So,  the criteria to request a parking reduction from the Commission would be half-a-mile from the major transit stop. It would have to be an accessible route from one quarter mile of that property of the development and a major transit stop. The Commission would consider any impact that parking reductions may have on a neighborhood and making sure its compatible with the surrounding area and the parking reductions are based on the size of the property.  So, a greater,  larger property would have less reduction and a larger reduction would be for the smaller properties and that would be to discourage larger,  taller buildings that may be out of character with the surrounding area.  And the Commission can also grant any rate of parking reductions that' s less than 6,000 square feet.  And that' s all I have.
