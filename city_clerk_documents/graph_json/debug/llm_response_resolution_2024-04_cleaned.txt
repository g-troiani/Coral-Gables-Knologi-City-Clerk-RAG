Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user wants only the code, like E-2 or F-10, and nothing else. Let me start by scanning through the entire text provided.

Looking at the first page, the document is Resolution No. 2024-04. The main body has several WHEREAS clauses and sections, but I don't see an agenda item mentioned there. The sections talk about approving an inventory list and publishing it, but no code yet.

Moving to the second page, after the resolution's adoption details, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-9)" right before the signatures and attestation parts. That looks like the code they're asking for. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other reference elsewhere. Scanning again, the rest of the document includes the DocuSign IDs and official signatures, but that line with "AgendaItem: E-9" is the only one that matches the format they want. So the code should be E-9. I need to confirm there's no other number or code that could be confused here. Nope, that's the only instance. The example responses show formats like E-2, so E-9 fits. I'll make sure to present it exactly as found, which is E-9.


AGENDA_ITEM: E-9
