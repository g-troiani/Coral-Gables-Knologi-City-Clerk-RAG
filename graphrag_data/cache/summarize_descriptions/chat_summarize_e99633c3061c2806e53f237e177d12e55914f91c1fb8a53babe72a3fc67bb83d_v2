Referenced by Aky Fernandez, this program provides significant incentives, including up to a 100 percent reduction in parking requirements for workforce housing projects located within 500 feet of a rail station. The tiered system adjusts parking discounts according to how close the housing is to various transit options such as rail stations and bus stops, encouraging transit-oriented development and reducing the need for extensive parking infrastructure. By linking parking reductions to transit accessibility and parcel characteristics, the Urban Center Program aims to promote affordable housing near public transportation, thereby enhancing urban density, reducing reliance on private vehicles, and supporting sustainable community growth in Miami-Dade County.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762941, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
