This project aims to improve the reliability, aesthetics, and safety of utility services by relocating utility lines underground. It is subject to administrative review based on specific criteria, ensuring that installations meet location, interference, and facility number requirements. The project’s scope includes the installation and conversion of various utility facilities such as communications, water, and sewer services.
