It is designed to replace an older structure on the southeast corner of the property and will house two classrooms, a multi-purpose room, and storage. The building includes a covered walkway canopy that will be enclosed for security and connect to another campus building, enhancing campus functionality. The design aims to balance functional needs with aesthetic considerations, including landscaping plans to improve the frontage after construction and removal of temporary gravel used during COVID drop-off procedures.

The Board collaborates with other local entities such as the Historic Preservation Board and the City of Coral Gables to maintain community aesthetics and regulatory compliance. Its role includes reviewing development plans, approving demolitions, and overseeing public hearing processes to ensure procedural compliance. The Board's involvement in the St. Philip's project was extensive, including multiple reviews and neighborhood meetings before granting approval. This oversight underscores the Board's influence in shaping the built environment and maintaining community standards [Data: Entities (600); Relationships (1160, 1166)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Mandated inclusion of windows on the eastern side despite prior restrictions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A significant point of contention in the new building's design was the inclusion of windows on the eastern side. The 2001-2003 master plan explicitly prohibited windows on this side to avoid an institutional appearance. However, the Board of Architects required the installation of fixed and operable windows for aesthetic enhancement, overriding the previous restriction. These windows are designed solely for visual appeal and do not function as emergency exits or ventilation sources. This decision reflects the Board's authority to adapt or reinterpret prior planning conditions to better align with current architectural goals and community aesthetics. The windows' presence also affects neighboring properties, particularly the neighbor to the east, who is adjacent to the driveway and garage near this portion of the building [Data: Entities (811, 1071); Relationships (1169, 1605, 1180)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Board of Architects' approval process involved multiple reviews and community engagement\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The approval of the new building design by the Board of Architects was not a singular event but the result of a thorough process. This included two formal reviews, participation in Development Review Committee (DRC) meetings, and neighborhood consultations. The Board required specific design modifications to avoid an institutional look, such as the inclusion of windows on the eastern side and other aesthetic considerations. Formal approvals were granted in April and August before the City Commission meeting, indicating a structured and transparent process.

On the eastern side, the windows face the driveway and garage of an adjacent neighbor, which may raise privacy or aesthetic concerns. These considerations demonstrate an effort to minimize negative impacts on neighbors while fulfilling the school's functional and aesthetic goals.

The new structure will be approximately the same size, housing two classrooms (Pre-K 3 and Pre-K 4), a multi-purpose room, and storage area. It includes a covered walkway canopy that will be enclosed for security and connect to another campus building. The Board of Architects approved the design after requiring windows on the eastern side, which were previously prohibited by a 2001-2003 master plan condition. The windows are fixed and operable for aesthetic purposes only.

One of its key roles includes working to standardize streetlight fixtures throughout Coral Gables, contributing to the city’s cohesive aesthetic and historic preservation efforts.\n\nIn addition to its advisory functions, the Board of Architects plays a critical role in the review and approval of development projects within Coral Gables. This includes participation in public hearing processes, where it ensures compliance with specific procedural requirements such as timely notice publication before hearings. The Board is also responsible for approving building demolitions and development plans, particularly those subject to restrictive covenants, as exemplified by its involvement in projects like St. Philip’s School.\n\nThe Board of Architects notably reviewed and approved the design for a new preschool building at St. Philip’s School. This approval process was thorough, involving multiple reviews, including Development Review Committee (DRC) and neighborhood meetings, with formal approvals granted in April and August prior to the City Commission meeting. During this process, the Board required specific design modifications to maintain the building’s aesthetic quality and avoid an institutional appearance. Notably, it mandated the inclusion of both fixed and operable windows on the eastern side of the new building, a decision that overrode a previous condition from the 2001-2003 master plan which had prohibited windows on that side. This change was made to enhance the building’s visual appeal and architectural integrity.\n\nOverall, the Board of Architects serves as a professional and regulatory body that ensures development projects in Coral Gables adhere to established architectural standards, historic preservation goals, and community aesthetic values, while also facilitating public involvement and compliance with local regulations.\",13\n811,WINDOWS ON EASTERN SIDE,\"Windows on the eastern side of the new building at St. Philip's, fixed and operable for aesthetic purposes only, required by the Board of Architects despite a prior condition prohibiting windows on that side.\",3\n1071,2001-2003 MASTER PLAN,The 2001-2003 master plan that included a condition prohibiting any windows on the eastern side of the building to avoid an institutional appearance.,1\n817,BOARD OF ARCHITECTS APPROVAL,The approval granted by the Board of Architects for the new building at St. Philip's after two reviews and required changes to window design.,2\n812,COVERED WALKWAY CANOPY,\"A covered walkway canopy on the new building at St. Philip's, enclosed for security and connecting to another building on campus.\",1\n816,SINGLE-FAMILY NEIGHBOR TO THE RIGHT,\"A single-family neighbor located to the right (back) of the new building at St. Philip's, facing a solid wall with extensive landscaping.\",1\n815,NEIGHBOR TO THE EAST,\"The adjacent neighbor to the east of St. Philip's property, near the driveway and garage, next to the portion of the new building with windows.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1160,NEW BUILDING,BOARD OF ARCHITECTS,\"The Board of Architects approved the new building design for St. Philip's after requiring windows on the eastern side, overriding a previous condition from the 2001-2003 master plan.\",22\n1169,BOARD OF ARCHITECTS,WINDOWS ON EASTERN SIDE,The Board of Architects required the installation of fixed and operable windows on the eastern side of the new building.,16\n1605,BOARD OF ARCHITECTS,2001-2003 MASTER PLAN,\"The Board of Architects requested windows on the eastern side of the building, which conflicted with the 2001-2003 master plan condition prohibiting windows on that side.\",14\n1166,NEW BUILDING,BOARD OF ARCHITECTS APPROVAL,The Board of Architects approval pertains to the new building design.,11\n1164,NEW BUILDING,COVERED WALKWAY CANOPY,The new building includes a covered walkway canopy that will be enclosed for security and connect to another building.,10\n1165,NEW BUILDING,SINGLE-FAMILY NEIGHBOR TO THE RIGHT,\"The back of the new building faces the single-family neighbor to the right, with a solid wall and extensive landscaping.\",10\n1180,WINDOWS ON EASTERN SIDE,NEIGHBOR TO THE EAST,The windows on the eastern side of the new building are adjacent to the driveway and garage of the neighbor to the east.,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
