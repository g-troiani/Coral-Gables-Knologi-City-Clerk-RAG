After its review, the board forwards its recommendations to the City Commission for final decisions.\n\nThe board is actively involved in addressing neighborhood concerns and improving community infrastructure. For example, it requested cooperation from a client to develop a swale package aimed at mitigating issues related to St. Philip's School. Additionally, in November, the Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval of a major amendment while also advocating for the expansion of swale improvements along Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia. These efforts demonstrate the board’s commitment to enhancing neighborhood landscaping and stormwater management.\n\nBeyond infrastructure, the board also influences decisions related to parking and neighborhood aesthetics. It has been a stakeholder in discussions concerning site plan amendments and parking solutions, such as those related to Agenda Item E-4. In one instance, the board recommended approval of a project with three specific conditions: ensuring window operability, maintaining existing conditions including child limits, and landscaping the front of the building. This highlights the board’s attention to both functional and community-oriented aspects of development projects.\n\nFurthermore, the Planning and Zoning Board serves as the body to which City staff report following the approval of a Zoning in Progress Resolution moratorium.

The package is designed to prevent parking on swales, thereby reducing enforcement calls and neighborhood disturbances associated with improper parking. It incorporates the use of native plants, coquina, and gravel to manage the swale areas effectively, balancing environmental considerations such as water use with the need to maintain parking availability. Overall, the SWALE PACKAGE serves as a strategic approach to enhance neighborhood safety, enforce parking regulations, and promote sustainable landscaping practices in swale zones.\",8\n569,SCHOOL,\"The SCHOOL is a nonprofit educational institution operating on the property since 2001, currently serving approximately 180 students. It benefits from an educational exemption but lacks dedicated parking facilities, which has led to ongoing parking and neighborhood maintenance issues.

This expansion has raised concerns among neighbors, including the Toyos family, who have noted potential violations of existing covenants related to property use.\n\nDespite these challenges, the school has not proposed increasing its student enrollment beyond the current limit and remains subject to prior approvals, site plan restrictions, and enrollment caps. The school is located near Salvadore Park and has been actively engaged in addressing neighborhood concerns, particularly regarding parking. It regularly communicates parking rules to parents through monthly newsletters and takes measures to prevent parking on swales to minimize disruption.\n\nOverall, the SCHOOL is navigating a complex situation involving growth and neighborhood relations, with ongoing efforts to resolve conflicts related to parking, property use, and community impact.\",20\n573,NEWSLETTER,\"The NEWSLETTER is a monthly publication produced by the school and distributed to all school parents.
