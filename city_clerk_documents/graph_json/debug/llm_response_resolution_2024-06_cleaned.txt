Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to search the entire document and extract only the code in the format like E-2 or H-1. No explanations, just the code.

First, I'll start by reading through the entire document text carefully. The document is Resolution No. 2024-06. Let me go through each line. 

Looking at the first page, there's a lot of text about accepting a recommendation for a piggyback contract, mentioning sections of the Procurement Code. I don't see an agenda item code here yet. 

Moving to the second page, under SECTION 2, it talks about authorizing access to the contract. Then after SECTION 3, there's the passage date and voting information. Then I notice "AgendaIem: H-1)" â€“ wait, that looks like a typo. It should probably be "Agenda Item" but it's written as "AgendaIem". But the code here is H-1. 

I need to confirm if that's the correct reference. The line says "AgendaIem: H-1)" followed by "APPROVED:" and the names. Since the user said to search the entire document, this seems like the only mention. The code is H-1. 

I should check again to make sure there's no other code mentioned elsewhere. Scanning again, the rest includes the DocuSign ID and other signatures, but nothing else that looks like an agenda item code. 

So the correct code here is H-1. The typo in "AgendaIem" might be a mistake in the document, but the code itself is present. The user just wants the code, so I should return that.


AGENDA_ITEM: H-1
