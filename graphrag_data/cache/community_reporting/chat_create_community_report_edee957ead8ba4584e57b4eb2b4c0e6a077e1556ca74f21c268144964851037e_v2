This includes requiring permits for the construction of bulkheads, seawalls, groins, breakwaters, wharves, docks, piers, and other related structures, as well as shore activities such as beach nourishment on submerged, tidal, or upland lands contiguous to the shoreline. The department reviews proposed construction plans, conducts investigations, and makes recommendations to the city commission prior to public hearings on permit applications. Upon approval by the city commission and relevant agencies, the department issues construction permits and ensures compliance with all permit requirements. This oversight includes establishing construction standards, determining appropriate performance bond amounts, requiring bond postings, and supervising engineering certifications throughout the construction process. Additionally, the City Public Works Department manages administrative responsibilities such as submitting written requests for extensions of permit timeframes before expiration, thereby ensuring that all waterfront construction and shore activities are conducted safely, legally, and in accordance with municipal regulations.\",5\n29,CITY COMMISSION,\"The City Commission of Coral Gables serves as the primary governing body responsible for overseeing a wide range of municipal functions and community matters. It conducts regular, adjourned, and special meetings to discuss and decide on issues affecting the city, including neighborhood concerns, park improvements such as those related to Salvadore Park, school agreements and expansions, signage regulations, and residential parking permits. The Commission actively engages in public hearings to consider applications for zoning changes, property vacations or abandonments, and construction permits, ensuring that decisions reflect the public interest and comply with relevant regulations.\n\nA key responsibility of the City Commission is the review and approval of zoning matters, including the consideration of zoning code regulations such as floor area ratio (FAR), open space requirements, parking, height, density, and preempted uses under the Live Local Act. It holds hearings on Zoning in Progress Resolutions, makes preliminary findings, approves or denies proposed zoning resolutions, and may impose moratoriums or extend resolution periods as necessary. The Commission also receives advice and recommendations from the City Manager, Development Review Committee, Planning and Zoning Board, and City Attorney to inform its decisions.\n\nThe Commission oversees the approval or disapproval of applications related to dredging, filling, and construction activities, including permits for bulkheads, seawalls, and upland property structures. These approvals require thorough public hearings and submission of biological and ecological studies, with final permits contingent upon approvals from state and federal agencies such as the trustees of the internal improvement fund and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Commission may deny applications for good cause to protect public health, safety, and welfare.\n\nIn addition to land use and environmental oversight, the City Commission is responsible for legislative actions including the enactment of ordinances and resolutions. This includes fixing and revising rates, fees, and charges related to the city’s sewage disposal system, as well as adopting resolutions concerning city-owned property sales or leases. The Commission enforces strict procedures for the sale or lease of city property, requiring public advertisement for at least 60 days and receipt of multiple written proposals or guaranteed market value returns before favorable consideration.\n\nThe City Commission also plays a critical role in the city’s electoral processes. It appoints substitute and alternate members to the canvassing board by resolution, may delegate appointment authority in emergencies, accepts certified election results, judges elections, canvasses returns, and declares official results at the first regular meeting following run-off elections.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission authorizes access to contracts, such as piggyback contracts, and directs city operations including the cessation or adoption of public infrastructure standards, exemplified by its directive to halt the removal of silver streetlights by Florida Power & Light and adopt a standard streetlight. It holds the authority to establish or modify city facilities by resolution and may direct operations without regard to zoning when necessary.\n\nOverall, the City Commission of Coral Gables functions as the central legislative and decision-making body dedicated to managing city affairs, safeguarding community interests, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting the health, safety, and welfare of its residents.\",51\n127,ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR ISSUANCE OF SEWER REVENUE BONDS,\"An ordinance or resolution enacted by the City Commission that provides for the issuance of sewer revenue bonds and fixes the initial schedule of rates, fees, and other charges for the use of the sewage disposal system, including provisions for revision and public hearing requirements.\",4\n280,ZONING IN PROGRESS RESOLUTION,\"The Zoning in Progress Resolution is a formal resolution reviewed and decided upon by the City Commission at the next available regularly scheduled meeting following the submittal of a Zoning in Progress request. During this meeting, the City Commission evaluates preliminary findings to either approve or deny the resolution. If approved, the resolution may impose a moratorium on zoning activities in the specified area to allow for a detailed analysis. This moratorium period is initially fixed and shall not exceed ninety (90) days, during which City staff are tasked with preparing a comprehensive report, including proposed ordinance amendments and recommendations, to be presented to both the Planning and Zoning Board and the City Commission.\n\nThe resolution period, including any moratorium, is limited to the first regularly scheduled City Commission meeting after 120 days from the date of approval. However, this period may be extended by up to 40 days if additional time is necessary. Extensions beyond this 40-day period can also be granted by the City Commission if deemed necessary and in the public interest. In cases where City staff are unable to complete their report within the prescribed timeframe, a one-time extension of up to 40 days may be granted following a public hearing.\n\nUpon adoption of the Zoning in Progress Resolution, the City Clerk is responsible for publishing the adopted resolution in Miami-Dade County, Florida, within ten (10) days. This publication ensures transparency and public awareness of the zoning moratorium and related proceedings.\n\nIn summary, the Zoning in Progress Resolution serves as a procedural tool allowing the City Commission to temporarily halt zoning activities in a designated area to facilitate thorough review and potential amendments to zoning ordinances. It balances the need for timely staff analysis with provisions for extensions to accommodate complex cases, all while maintaining public notification requirements.\",4\n156,CITY MANAGER (APPLICATION CONTEXT),The official who receives recommendations and objections from the development review committee regarding applications for vacations or abandonments and advises the city commission accordingly.,3\n217,TRUSTEES OF THE INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT FUND,\"The Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund are a state governmental authority responsible for overseeing and approving permits related to dredging, filling, and construction activities, particularly those involving upland property structures and shoreline developments such as bulkheads and seawalls.
