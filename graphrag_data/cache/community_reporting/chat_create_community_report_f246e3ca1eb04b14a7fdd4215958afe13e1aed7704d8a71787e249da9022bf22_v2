He is tasked with scheduling bimonthly presentations and protocol ceremonies as directed by Resolution F-10, ensuring organized communication and formal proceedings within the city administration.\n\nIn matters related to urban development, the City Manager plays a critical advisory role. He receives recommendations and objections from the Development Review Committee and the Development Review Officer’s reports, consulting with the City Attorney as necessary. Based on these inputs, he formulates and submits informed recommendations to the City Commission, including decisions regarding the approval of government settlements. The City Manager also establishes the form and timing for receipt of these recommendations, facilitating a structured review process.\n\nAdditionally, the City Manager or his designee holds authority over the regulation of facility installations on properties. This includes the power to reject the placement of multiple facilities on a single property and to grant reasonable exceptions to limits on such installations. He is responsible for enforcing compliance with underground utility service facility requirements. This enforcement role involves notifying property owners upon completion of required conversions, determining if a building has failed to complete the mandated underground conversion, and issuing notices to property owners who are non-compliant.\n\nShould property owners fail to comply with conversion requirements, the City Manager is authorized to order the city to perform the necessary conversions.
