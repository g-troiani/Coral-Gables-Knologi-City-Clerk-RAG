However, it is currently considered insufficient when compared to similar airport rail systems in major cities such as Atlanta, New York, and Washington, DC. In these cities, airport rail provides direct access from baggage claim areas to the transit network, offering a seamless and convenient connection for travelers. In contrast, the existing Airport Rail project lacks this level of integration and accessibility, limiting its effectiveness and convenience for airport passengers. Efforts to improve the Airport Rail service aim to enhance connectivity and provide a more direct, user-friendly transit option comparable to those found in leading metropolitan areas.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749233510, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
