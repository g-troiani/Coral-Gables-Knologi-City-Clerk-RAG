Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to search the entire document for any mention of an agenda item code, which is typically a letter followed by a number like E-2 or F-10. 

First, I'll start by reading through the entire document text provided. The document is Resolution No. 2024-03 from the City of Coral Gables. The main body talks about directing the City Clerk to schedule a joint meeting between two boards to discuss replacing streetlights. The WHEREAS clauses and the sections outline the purpose and procedures.

Looking through each section:

- The first page has the resolution details, sections 1, 2, 3, and another section 3 (maybe a typo?), and mentions the effective date. No agenda item code here yet.

- The second page has the DocuSign info, the passage date (9th of January 2024), the vote details with "Yeas" and the unanimous vote. Then, right after the vote, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: F-11)". 

Ah, there it is! The line "AgendaItem: F-11)" is clearly labeled. The code here is F-11. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning again, the rest of the page has approvals from the Mayor, City Clerk, and City Attorney, but no other references to an agenda item. 

The code is written as "F-11" with a hyphen, which fits the required format (letter and number). The example given in the instructions includes formats like E-2 or F-10, so F-11 follows the same structure. 

No other parts of the document mention an agenda item, so this must be the correct one. I should ignore the resolution number (2024-03) since that's the document number, not the agenda item. 

Therefore, the correct code is F-11. The user wants only the code in the specified format, so the answer should be AGENDA_ITEM: F-11.

AGENDA_ITEM: F-11
