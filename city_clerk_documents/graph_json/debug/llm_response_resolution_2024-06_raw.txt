Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the format like E-2 or H-1. If there's none, I should say NOT_FOUND.

First, I'll start by reading through the document carefully. The document is Resolution No. 2024-06 from the City of Coral Gables. The user mentioned that the example response includes something like "AgendaIem: H-1)" so I should look for any line that has "Agenda" followed by some code.

Looking at the provided text, the first part is the resolution's preamble and the various WHEREAS clauses. Then in the sections, it talks about accepting the recommendation, authorizing the contract, and effectiveness. 

Scrolling down to the end of the document, there's a section that says: "AgendaIem: H-1)" â€” wait, that might be a typo, maybe they meant "Agenda Item" but it's written as "AgendaIem". But regardless, the key part is the code after it. The code here is H-1. 

I need to make sure there's no other code mentioned elsewhere. Let me check again. The document mentions sections of the Procurement Code like 2-946 and 2-947, but those are sections, not agenda items. The only place that has something close to an agenda item is that line near the end. 

Even though "AgendaIem" is probably a typo for "Agenda Item", the code following it is H-1. Since the instruction says to extract the code even if there's a typo, as long as it's the correct reference. 

Therefore, the correct code here is H-1. I don't see any other codes mentioned, so that must be the one. The answer should be AGENDA_ITEM: H-1.

AGENDA_ITEM: H-1
