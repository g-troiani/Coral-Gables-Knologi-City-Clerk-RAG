The realtor has noted that many property sellers avoid using MLS due to associated fees and have not yet engaged with LoopNet, highlighting gaps in the commercial real estate listing ecosystem.

This realtor's expertise and direct observation methods provide valuable market intelligence that is not captured by traditional listing services. The realtor's role is critical in bridging the gap between property availability and market awareness, especially given the limitations of formal listing platforms.

This approach suggests that some properties may be underrepresented or absent from formal listings, potentially due to seller preferences or market dynamics.
