Mr. Clerk,  moving on to Item E-8.  Commissioner Fernandez,  this is your item.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  Mayor,  E-8 is an ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code amending Article 11, ' Signs,' Section 11-107,  real estate for sale, lease, or rental of property or buildings to apply same regulations to signs pertaining to the sale,  lease,  or rental of property or buildings in any use district;  providing for severability clause,  repealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date.  This is a public hearing item.  I've asked the Deputy City Attorney to please explain what the proposed ordinance sets forth.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: So,  just a little on the --  on the background on why I put this on the agenda.   It came from a resident who had asked me, why is there a difference between the size of signs that are allowed in residential neighborhoods versus in commercial?   And started looking into it and started driving around downtown Coral Gables and I did see how some of these signs are pretty large and you have windows that just --  just have the sign up.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Oh, you need to rewind it right now.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   Yeah,  start all over?  So…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Take it back.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:   If we are take --  if we are doing so much to ensure the beautification of our Central Business District and our business area of our city,  we invest so much time in ensuring that we have the right window coverings,  I think it' s important to also reduce the size of some of these signs that are being placed on windows,  some of them for an extended period of time when they are for management companies,  just to ensure that we maintain a uniform look, if we' re talking about uniform look for our lights as well,  uniform look for our signs.   I did have conversations with a few commercial real estate agents before putting this item on the agenda.  The general consensus I got from them --  and I know there are differing opinions because we have received some emails from realtors about this item -- but the general consensus was that they have not seen a lot of clients lately that have just been driving around the city or walking around looking for property.   Most commercial clients have a realtor that they' re familiar with or that they use, and they work with them to find the property.  So, the larger signs are not necessarily as important.\n\nAssistant City Attorney\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-8<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-8 discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning a text amendment to the City’s Zoning Code related to signs for real estate sale, lease, or rental.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE TEXT AMENDMENT TO ZONING CODE<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables official Zoning Code, amending Article 11, 'Signs,' Section 11-107 regarding real estate signs for sale, lease, or rental in any use district; includes severability clause, repealer provision, codification, and effective date.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES CITY COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The governing body of Coral Gables, Florida, responsible for city legislation and meetings including the January 9, 2024 meeting where agenda item E-8 was discussed.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR VINCE LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor of Coral Gables presiding over the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR RHONDA ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor of Coral Gables participating in the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MELISSA CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>City Commissioner attending the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER ARIEL FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>City Commissioner sponsoring agenda item E-8 and presenting the ordinance text amendment at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER KIRK MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>City Commissioner attending the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY ATTORNEY CRISTINA SUÁREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney providing legal explanation of ordinance related to agenda item E-8.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSISTANT CITY ATTORNEY STEPHANIE THROCKMORTON<|>PERSON<|>Assistant City Attorney involved in explaining the proposed ordinance for agenda item E-8.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY MANAGER PETER IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY CLERK BILLY URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk managing the meeting proceedings on January 9, 2024.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR BELKYS PEREZ<|>PERSON<|>City staff member present at the January 9, 2024 meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC SPEAKER SARAH HERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Citizen speaker participating in the discussion of agenda item E-8.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC SPEAKER MANNY CHAMIZO<|>PERSON<|>Citizen speaker participating in the discussion of agenda item E-8.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC SPEAKER THAD ADAMS<|>PERSON<|>Citizen speaker participating in the discussion of agenda item E-8.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT 01_09_2024 - E-8.PDF<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>Document identifier for the verbatim transcript of the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, covering agenda item E-8.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>01.09.2024 CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, during which agenda item E-8 was discussed.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-8<|>ORDINANCE TEXT AMENDMENT TO ZONING CODE<|>Agenda item E-8 is the subject of the ordinance text amendment discussed and presented at the meeting.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORDINANCE TEXT AMENDMENT TO ZONING CODE<|>E-8<|>Ordinance relates directly to agenda item E-8 as it amends zoning code provisions discussed under this item.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>01.09.2024 CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>E-8<|>Agenda item E-8 was discussed during the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>01.09.2024 CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT 01_09_2024 - E-8.PDF<|>The transcript document records the proceedings of the January 9, 2024 meeting covering agenda item E-8.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES CITY COMMISSION<|>01.09.2024 CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>The City Commission is the organization conducting the January 9, 2024 meeting.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER ARIEL FERNANDEZ<|>E-8<|>Commissioner Fernandez is the sponsor and presenter of agenda item E-8.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY ATTORNEY CRISTINA SUÁREZ<|>ORDINANCE TEXT AMENDMENT TO ZONING CODE<|>City Attorney provided legal explanation of the ordinance text amendment.<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSISTANT CITY ATTORNEY STEPHANIE THROCKMORTON<|>ORDINANCE TEXT AMENDMENT TO ZONING CODE<|>Assistant City Attorney explained the proposed ordinance.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY CLERK BILLY URQUIA<|>E-8<|>City Clerk managed the meeting proceedings related to agenda item E-8.<|>7)##\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
