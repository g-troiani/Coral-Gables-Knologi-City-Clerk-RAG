We need to make sure there' s something in front of it protecting it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Besides that. How much did we spend on the park in the last three years?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  On the park or on Miracle Mile?\n\nMayor Lago:  No, no. Miracle Mile is another thing. On the park.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I don' t know.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  I know it was a big investment.  Mr. Manager,  we hadn' t changed the decorations in decades,  correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  We changed it about three years ago and we are up on the new contract now.\n\nMayor Lago:  But what was the number,  it was massive.  We spent a lot of money.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  I think it was 250, 300, something like that…\n\nMayor Lago: We spent a lot of money on the park and obviously,  we' ve also spent,  how much did we spend on Miracle Mile so far?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Miracle Mile and Giralda for the holiday decorations, 147,000 and my budget was $150,000.\n\nMayor Lago:  Did we buy these ornaments,  or these were just rented?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez: There' s only a certain portion which was bought. Basically,  they were hand made for us, so the ornaments that are hanging from the trees and the ones that are on the median,  the stars that are on the median,  that is the only thing that we will continue with for the next three years.  So, two more years we' ve got of that. And then everything else,  so about $ 64,000, we have the ability to go out and we are going to go out to get bids for the rest of those decorations.  We did that because we, you know, I hear you Commissioner,  but I think decorations are really subjective.  Some people could like it, some people not,  and so we really wanted to start with a pallet where you could see decorations.  Last year the ones that we had were one ornament per block,  that' s the only thing we were able to get, and it was lit at night as well, also had a lighting component to it, but there was only one per block. I really don' t think that was enough for the street.  I don' t think it was significant enough for the type of street that we have.\n\nMayor Lago: If I may, if you would educate the Commission.  Over the last few years, we' ve been talking about the lack of lighting,  full-time lighting throughout the year of the oak trees,  and obviously,  Christmas Tree lighting.  That to me, has been,  I think is priority number one.  When you talk about Christmas -  the ornaments are beautiful,  I want to see lights.  I want to see lights hanging from the oak trees.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  You mean like the full year.\n\nMayor Lago:  Again,  I wouldn' t have an issue with it. I don' t have an issue with it. But that' s something that people have talked to me about it,  and it makes a lot of sense.  We could do something beautiful,  well done, tasteful,  doesn' t have to be bright neon.  It could be a softer color, but I think that it would benefit the street significantly and it would give a festive kind of feel to it throughout\n\nCity Commission Meeting the year.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  The lighting is really what detracted from the decorations,  because you couldn' t even see them. The stars on the palm trees, I was hard-pressed to find them, because you could see where they were.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  At night.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  So, two things.  The string lights that are on the trees that are on Miracle Mile, the swales,  they are currently lit only up to the trunk.  So, this was a project that was put in place to replace those,  that was a project that had been started by the former Business Improvement District.  They paid 50 percent of it. We are picking it up as part of the budget process.  We did ask for the $79,000 that it would cost to complete that project,  and so,  I did receive that.  That is going to be a project that' s going to start in February.  We didn' t want to do it in the middle of the holiday season,  because we weren' t sure when it would be done, and so because our budget just started in October,  we wanted to have enough time to be able to have it. So that' s a year- round lighting that would be installed,  and we have talked to that vendor,  and they know that they need to go up some of the branches.  I'm not sure how many string lights were purchased,  because it' s not our project,  but we want to go up.\n\nMayor Lago:  But this is something that we' ve been talking about,  Commissioner,  for two years. I know the BID fell apart and everything\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item referenced as a typical example in instructions;
