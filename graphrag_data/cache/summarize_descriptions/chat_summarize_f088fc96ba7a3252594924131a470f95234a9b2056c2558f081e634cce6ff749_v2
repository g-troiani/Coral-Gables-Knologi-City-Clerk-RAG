This ordinance established various conditions of approval for the school’s site, including specific requirements such as non-operable fixed windows on the façade facing the adjacent neighbor to the east and swale improvements at the front of the property. Recently, Ordinance No. 3576 has been amended by Agenda Item E-4 to permit the replacement of an existing building on the site with a new pre-kindergarten (pre-K) building. Despite this amendment allowing the new construction, all other original conditions of approval outlined in Ordinance No. 3576 remain in full effect. This ensures that the original site plan’s requirements continue to govern the property, maintaining the intended design and operational standards established for St. Philip's School.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762933, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
