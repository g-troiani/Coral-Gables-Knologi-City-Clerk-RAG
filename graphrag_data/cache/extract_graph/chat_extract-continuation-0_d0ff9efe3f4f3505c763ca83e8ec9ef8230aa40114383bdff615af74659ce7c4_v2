[{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document from the City of Coral Gables, identify all entities and their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It was the Planning and Zoning Board that said,  hey, you, you guys, this is on you.   It wasn' t us asking the Planning and Zoning Board.   We just went up there and,  how do you call it, said we have a traffic problem. They' re blocking our driveways.   Yeah,  I mean,  and this happens,  how do you call it, constantly. And I keep on hearing it's the Salvadore Park, people who come to Salvadore Park,  the dog park, the pickleballers.   I don' t see people with pickleball rackets coming down, you know, blocking our driveways or doing that.  We' re trying to just keep our swales like any normal one.  Yes, we have normal use of swale,  delivery guys,  postal service,  whatever. But at least with that,  we could maintain our grass.   We can' t maintain our grass.   Their side looks like a desert,  okay, on Cordova side.\n\nMs. Toyos:  ( INAUDIBLE)  the pictures?\n\nMr.  Toyos: One of our neighbors behind them has had his swale with,  how do you call it, landscaping now for, as long as I can remember.   You know, we' ve owned that property for over 20 years. They' ve had it for much more than that,  so they' ve dealt with it.   Our backdoor neighbors,  Mary and --  this is what it looks like.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is what the neighbors do to our sidewalks.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And this is what the other neighbors have to do to make sure that they don' t block them when the pickup and drop-off (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMr. Toyos:  This is barricades put up by, I guess,  the City.\n\nMs. Toyos:   Yeah.\n\nMr. Toyos:   The signs are being used to help the --  the signs alone are not enough.   This is what they' ve used to keep the people off the corner so that the intersection visibility doesn' t get blocked.\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Toyos:   Sometimes I can' t get out of my house because people are blocking my entrance and exit.\n\nMr. Toyos:  Backdoor neighbor,  she had to put it because her driveway' s in the front, so Andalusia, corner of Andalusia,  and right behind us,  and -on Cordova,  they had to put landscape in their front.  Now their side is still barren.   They can' t do anything.   It's --  I mean,  we can' t maintain our grass.   And it's not the people using the dog park.   It's not the people using the pickleball courts or tennis courts.  It's parents.   And we reached out to the pastor,  with all due respect,  in 2022.  We went in and we sat with her.  Nothing' s come from it.  Nothing.   The Planning and Zoning asked them,  hey, reach out to the neighbor.   Just try to take care of their situation.\n\nMs. Toyos:   They didn' t reach out.\n\nMr. Toyos:   Nothing.   We' ve tried to be neighborly. And to say that we' re not --  asking is not neighborly,  no, it was the Planning and Zoning Board.   All of them agreed that, hey, this is on you guys.   This is not on them.   So, we just want a solution,  but we also want to know --  there' s two issues here.   They bought that house in 2016 and now has an exemption.   So, they' re paying $ 67. So, I imagine that they' re having a school and it says an educational exemption on that property in the corner right across from us.  And by the way, we' re only 130 feet.  We might not be adjacent, but our radius,  we' re 130 feet from their closest property line, their campus property line.  So,  if they' re there and they' re claiming that exemption,  what' s the use of this property?   Because this is what' s causing the issues. If they' re going to keep on buying single- family homes and converting them over into school space,  it defeats the purpose.   They have no parking.   They have zero parking.   This should have been done with 30, 40 years ago when they expanded or they did this amendment and all that stuff.  This should have taken place because they just didn' t have the parking.   This is a -- they have unique circumstances than other schools,  okay?  St. Teresa,  Ponce, Coral Gables,  all those schools,  they have parking.   They don' t have parking.   They do not have parking.  So, we need to come up with a solution,  okay, where they actively patrol or do something, but they' re not doing that.   But then we also need to know,  what are their future plans?   Are we going to keep on --  they' re one single- family home away from owning all of Coral Way,  okay, Orlando' s home and the one that they bought here.   And that' s it, we' re done.   So,  what is the future plans here\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Planning and Zoning Board<|>organization<|>The Planning and Zoning Board, an organization involved in addressing swale improvement issues and directing responsibility for the problem to others, as stated in the immediate context where they told the speakers \"this is on you\".)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Salvadore Park<|>project<|>Salvadore Park, a dog park and pickleball facility mentioned as a location whose users are not responsible for blocking driveways or causing swale maintenance issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cordova Side<|>project<|>Cordova Side, a location referenced as having barren swale conditions and poor grass maintenance compared to the other side.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ms. Toyos<|>person<|>Ms. Toyos, a speaker in the discussion who comments on the swale and driveway blocking issues and interacts with Mr. Toyos.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mr. Toyos<|>person<|>Mr. Toyos, a speaker describing the swale landscaping issues, neighbor relations, and concerns about property use and parking related to a nearby school property.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City<|>organization<|>The City, implied to be responsible for placing barricades and signs to prevent driveway blocking and improve intersection visibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Barricades<|>project<|>Barricades placed by the City to keep people off the corner and prevent blocking of intersection visibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>meeting<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, during which the swale and driveway blocking issues were discussed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Property Bought in 2016<|>project<|>A single-family home property bought in 2016, currently having an educational exemption and located approximately 130 feet from the speakers' property line, causing parking and usage issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Educational Exemption<|>document_number<|>An educational exemption applied to the property bought in 2016, resulting in a $67 payment and implying school use of the property.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>School<|>organization<|>A school occupying the property bought in 2016, lacking parking facilities and causing neighborhood concerns about expansion and property use.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pastor<|>person<|>The pastor contacted in 2022 by the speakers to address neighborhood concerns, but no resolution was achieved.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Planning and Zoning Board<|>Mr. Toyos<|>The Planning and Zoning Board told Mr. Toyos and others that the swale improvement responsibility was on them, not on the Board, as stated \"All of them agreed that, hey, this is on you guys.\"<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City<|>Barricades<|>The City placed barricades to keep people off the corner and prevent blocking of intersection visibility, as described by Mr. Toyos.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mr. Toyos<|>Pastor<|>Mr. Toyos and others reached out to the pastor in 2022 to address the swale and neighborhood issues, but nothing came from it.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Property Bought in 2016<|>Educational Exemption<|>The property bought in 2016 has an educational exemption applied to it, paying $67, indicating school use.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Property Bought in 2016<|>School<|>The property bought in 2016 is used by a school that lacks parking and is causing neighborhood concerns.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Salvadore Park<|>Mr. Toyos<|>Mr. Toyos states that the people using Salvadore Park, including the dog park and pickleballers, are not responsible for blocking driveways or causing swale issues.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cordova Side<|>Mr. Toyos<|>Mr. Toyos describes the Cordova side as barren and poorly maintained compared to their side.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Mr. Toyos<|>Mr. Toyos spoke at the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, discussing the swale and neighborhood issues.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
