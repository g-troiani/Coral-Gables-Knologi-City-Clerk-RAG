This ordinance amends multiple sections of the City of Coral Gables Zoning Code, specifically Sections 1-104, 8-109, 8-106, 14-209.4, 14-215.3, and 15-102. The primary purpose of these amendments is to provide a clear definition of \"publication\" within the zoning code and to remove the longstanding requirement for legal notices to be published in newspapers. Instead, the ordinance permits the publication of legal notices through online means, reflecting a modernization of the City’s legal notice procedures.\n\nThe ordinance includes standard legislative provisions such as a repealer clause, a severability clause, codification instructions, and an effective date. The changes were discussed and unanimously approved by the City Commission during the meeting held on January 9, 2024, as part of the City of Coral Gables’ legislative process. This amendment streamlines the legal notice publication requirements, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency in how the City communicates zoning-related legal notices to the public.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840821, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 257, "prompt_tokens": 559, "total_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
