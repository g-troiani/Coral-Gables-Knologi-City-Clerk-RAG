Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code in the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the format like H-1, E-2, etc. If there's none, return NOT_FOUND.

First, I'll start by scanning the entire document text provided. The user mentioned to check the entire document, so I can't miss any part. Let me go line by line.

Starting from the top: The document is Resolution No. 2024-06. The title mentions accepting a recommendation for a piggyback contract. The first few sections are the WHEREAS clauses, which are the background reasons. Then there are references to sections of the Procurement Code like 2-946 and 2-947. 

Moving down, in the SECTION 2 part, it mentions "piggyback contract # 11031-OCK-1" but that's a contract number, not an agenda item code. The sections continue, and then towards the end, after the vote details, there's a line that says "AgendaIem: H-1)". Wait, that looks like a typo. "AgendaIem" might be "Agenda Item" with a capital I but maybe a typo where 'Iem' is instead of 'Item'. But the code here is H-1. 

Let me check again. The line is: "AgendaIem: H-1)". The word "AgendaIem" is probably a typo for "Agenda Item". Since the user said to look for the agenda item code, this is likely the correct line. The code here is H-1. 

I should make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning again, the rest of the document has the approved signatures and other details, but no other codes. The contract number 11031-OCK-1 is part of the contract reference, not the agenda item. 

Therefore, the correct code is H-1. The typo in "AgendaIem" might be a formatting error, but the structure matches the examples given. The user said to return only the code, so that's it.

AGENDA_ITEM: H-1
