strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

After the adoption by the commission of a resolution setting forth the preliminary schedule or schedules fixing and classifying such rates,  fees and charges,  notice of such public hearing,  setting forth the proposed schedule or schedules of rates,  fees and charges,  shall be given by one publication in a newspaper published in the city at least ten days before the date fixed in such notice for the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time.  After such hearing, such preliminary schedule,  either as originally adopted or as modified or amended,  shall be adopted and put into effect,  and thereupon the ordinance or resolution providing for the issuance of sewer revenue bonds may be finally adopted.  A copy of the schedule of such rates,  fees and charges finally fixed in such ordinance or resolution shall be kept on file in the office of the city manager and shall be open to inspection by all parties interested. The rates, fees or charges so fixed for any class of users or property served shall be extended to cover any additional properties thereafter served which fall within the same class, without the necessity of any hearing or notice. Any change or revision of such rates, fees or charges may be made in the same manner as such rates, fees or charges were originally established as hereinbefore provided, but if such change or revision be made substantially pro rata as to all classes of service no hearing or notice shall be required.\n\n## Sec.  2-1091. City-owned property sale or lease generally;  advertised public bidding process.\n\nNotwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Code,  and except as provided below,  the city commission is prohibited from favorably considering any sale or lease of cityowned property unless ( i) there shall have been, prior to the date of the city commission' s consideration of such sale or lease,  an advertisement soliciting proposals for said sale or lease published in a daily newspaper of general paid circulation in the city,  allowing not less than 60 days for the city's receipt of proposals from prospective purchasers or lessees,  said advertisement to be no less than one- fourth page and the headline in the advertisement to be in a type no smaller than 18-point and, ( ii) except as provided, there shall have been at least three written proposals received from prospective purchasers or lessees; except,  if there are less than three such proposals received, the guaranteed return under the proposal whose acceptance is being considered is at least equal to market value,  and the city commission determines that the contemplated sale or lease at that time will be in the city's best interest.\n\n## Sec.  18-2. - Canvass of returns;  duty of commission; declaration of results.\n\na)The city commission shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its own members. As soon after an election as may be, the commission shall canvass the returns and declare the results prior to 12:00 noon of the third day following such general election.  The candidate receiving a majority of the votes in each group shall be considered elected. In any election for Groups One through Five, if a majority of the vote is not received by any one candidate of a group, a run-off between the two candidates receiving the most votes in the respective group shall be held two weeks after the general election, on a Tuesday.  The candidate receiving the most votes in the run- off shall be considered elected.  The mayor and commissioners shall take office at noon on the third Friday after the general election.  No run- off election shall be required when a candidate receives a majority of the vote or if a candidate is unopposed in the run- off election.\n\nb)Any person seeking to run for the office of mayor or as a city commissioner who is unable to pay the qualification fee without imposing an undue burden on personal appearances or on resources otherwise available to him or her, shall,  upon written notification of such inability given under oath to the city clerk, be exempt from paying the qualifying fee.\n\nc)The canvassing of absentee ballots shall be conducted by a canvassing board composed of three members,  which shall include two members of the city commission who are not candidates with opposition in the election being canvassed,  and the city clerk or his or her designee from the city clerk's office.\n\nd)If sufficient members of the city commission are not eligible to serve on the canvassing board, the city commission shall appoint as a substitute member a qualified elector of the city who is not a candidate with opposition in the election being canvassed,  and who is not an active\n\nparticipant in the campaign or candidacy of any candidate with opposition in the election being canvassed. City commission may appoint alternate members to the canvassing board by resolution and may delegate to an appropriate official,  the appointment of a replacement in the event of an emergency where there is insufficient time for the city commission to appoint a replacement.\n\n- e)The canvassing board shall meet at a time and place to be designated by the city clerk after 7:00 a.m. the day of the election to publicly canvass the absentee electors' ballots.\n- f)A chairperson shall be selected by the canvassing board.\n- g)Criteria for the selection of the\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 32768, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ffb3058ed161bb01ec1c4e7cfb7eed4bff42132a8d25baf2050c5319b7cae3ed_v2"}
