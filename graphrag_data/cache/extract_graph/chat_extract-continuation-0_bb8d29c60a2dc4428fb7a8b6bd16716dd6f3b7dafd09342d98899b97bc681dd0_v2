From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

And any --  and again,  now' s the time to address other issues that are both beneficial for the school and for yourself.   And maybe the City can do better in that area.   Maybe we can be a better partner in one form or another.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   If we go the route of the signs,  I'll tell you right now, the signs --  and the reason I smile is because the signs are being used with tape lines to hold barricades that are not supposed to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:   And that' s what we' re going to -- and that' s what we' re going to talk about.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   And they' re not being enforced.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nVice Mayor Anderson: That' s why I said to meet with the Landscape Department. They' re fabulous.   We have a nice swale package.\n\nMs. Russo:   And maybe someone from Parks and Rec could also be at the meeting…\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Good idea.\n\nMs. Russo:   Since…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Yeah.\n\nMs. Russo:   Along with the City Manager and the City Attorney.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Manager will make sure that his team is there.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:   Well, I think we cannot leave Salvadore issue --  park issue out, so I expect them to be there.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.  So, we' ll --  then we' ll be hearing you from the end of February,  correct?\n\nMs. Russo:   The end of February,  yes.\n\nMayor Lago:   That gives enough time to have meetings and everything like that.\n\nMs. Russo:   Perfect.\n\nMayor Lago: Alright,  we' re going to take a five-minute break so everybody can go to the bathroom.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Thank you.\n\n\n=== END OF ITEM E-4 TRANSCRIPT
