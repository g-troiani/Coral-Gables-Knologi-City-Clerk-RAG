These hearings are preceded by a notice published in a newspaper of general circulation, typically at least ten to fifteen days prior to the meeting, ensuring adequate public awareness. In addition to the published notice, courtesy notices are often mailed to nearby or riparian property owners within a defined radius—commonly within 1,000 feet of the proposed work or affected property—and signs may be posted on the relevant site to further inform the community. The public hearing provides an opportunity for all users, interested parties, and members of the public to be heard, including the chance to speak during the designated portion of the meeting. Language assistance may also be made available to ensure accessibility for non-English speakers. These hearings are typically held after thorough investigation and recommendation by relevant city departments, such as the public works department, to ensure informed decision-making by the City Commission.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749844116, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 589, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
