This notification is critical to initiate the process whereby Attaching Entities must either underground their facilities or remove attachments from these redundant poles. This role ensures that the utility infrastructure remains organized and compliant with regulations, preventing unnecessary or obsolete pole usage. The Pole Owner's duties also extend to coordinating with the city to maintain regulatory standards during the conversion process.
