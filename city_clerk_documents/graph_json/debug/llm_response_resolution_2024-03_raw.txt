Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to search the entire document for any mention of an agenda item code, extract only the code (like E-2 or F-10), and return it in the specified format. If there's none, I should say NOT_FOUND.

First, I'll start by reading through the entire document text provided. Let me go line by line. The document starts with the resolution number 2024-03. Then there's the title of the resolution about directing the City Clerk to schedule a joint meeting between two boards regarding streetlight replacements. The WHEREAS clauses mention FPL's work and the Commission's desire for a joint meeting. 

Looking at the sections, Section 1 ratifies the WHEREAS clauses. Section 2 directs the City Clerk to schedule the meeting. Section 3 talks about how the meeting should be noticed and advertised. Then there's another Section 3? Wait, maybe a typo, but that's part of the document. Then Section about the resolution taking effect upon passage. 

Continuing down, there's a DocuSign ID, then on Page 2, it says "PASSED AND ADOPTED..." followed by the vote details. Then here's a line that says "AgendaItem: F-11)". That looks like the agenda item code. 

Wait, the line is "AgendaItem: F-11)". The parentheses might be a typo, but the code is F-11. The example given in the user's instructions includes codes like F-10, so F-11 fits the pattern. 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Let me scan again. The rest of the page has the mayor's approval, attestation by the City Clerk, and the City Attorney's approval. No other agenda item codes mentioned. 

So the correct code here is F-11. The user wants only the code, so the answer should be AGENDA_ITEM: F-11. I need to ensure there's no extra text, just that exact format. Also, check if "AgendaItem" is written as one word or two, but in the document it's written as "AgendaItem" with a capital A and I, but the code is F-11. Since the example uses hyphens, and the document uses a hyphen in F-11, that's correct. 

No other codes are present. So the answer is F-11.
