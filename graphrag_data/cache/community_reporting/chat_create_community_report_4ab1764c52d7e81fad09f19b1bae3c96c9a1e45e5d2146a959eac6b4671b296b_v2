Additionally, the Design and Innovation District along U.S.-1 and the Urban Center near the City of South Miami are part of these mixed-use districts. These geographic zones represent strategic urban areas targeted for increased affordable housing density and development flexibility, reflecting a localized response to state mandates [Data: Entities (796, 812, 813, 814, 815, 816); Relationships (1154, 1155, 1156, 1157, 1158)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Preemption of local height and density limitations by the Live Local Act\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Live Local Act preempts Coral Gables' existing height and density limitations to facilitate affordable housing projects.

Similarly, the citywide density cap of 125 units per acre is subject to analysis and adjustment under the Act's provisions. These regulatory changes enable developers to build more units and taller structures than previously allowed, aiming to increase affordable housing stock.
