The school’s enrollment has remained steady without significant increases, as noted by Cecilia Slesnick, who also highlighted the church community as a special and distinct group within the area. The church owns multiple properties, including a residence at 1100 Coral Way, which serves as housing for clergy and the head of the school. During the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, it was clarified that these church-owned properties, such as the residence, are separate from the school facilities and are not considered part of the school’s campus. Additionally, the church community has been involved in discussions related to local parking and swale issues, reflecting its active engagement with neighborhood and municipal concerns. Overall, St. Philip's Church functions as both a religious and educational institution with dedicated property holdings and a stable school enrollment, maintaining a significant presence in Coral Gables.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762934, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
