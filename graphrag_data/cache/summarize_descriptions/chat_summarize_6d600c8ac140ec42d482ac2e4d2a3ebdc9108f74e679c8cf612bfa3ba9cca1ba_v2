This usage has raised neighborhood concerns, supported by photographic evidence submitted by Ms. Russo, highlighting the challenges posed by vehicle parking in these areas. As a landscaping feature, the swale requires regular irrigation and maintenance to sustain its plantings; however, the presence of parked vehicles has caused damage to the vegetation, complicating upkeep efforts.
