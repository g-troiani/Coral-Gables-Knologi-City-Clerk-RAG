Its role is crucial in ensuring that signage used by commercial brokers adheres to mandated standards, thereby promoting transparency and protecting consumer interests. The DBPR's regulatory scope includes specifying the exact language that must appear on signs advertising properties for sale, lease, or rent, which underscores its authoritative position in this domain.
