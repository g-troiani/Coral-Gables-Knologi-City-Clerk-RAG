Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2.

A lot of schools have these covenants in place to show that they' re following the rules.   This is nothing new.   So, I have to look into that with the City Manager and my colleagues will do the same thing.   They' ll look at that with the City Manager and with Ms. Russo.   We' ll look at the documents to make sure that they' re adhering to the documents that must be submitted as per their agreement. If we' re not going to talk about expansion today,  that' s something that we' re going to talk about in the future, fine.   But I just want to put on the record,  there has to be --  a solution has to be found in the neighborhood,  because obviously,  this is not working.   And if the swale,  the Planning and Zoning Board is asking for cooperation from your client to put together some sort of swale package,  I want my -- I want input from my colleagues to see what do you think is the best opportunity,  and I know that Ms. Russo wants to respond,  so I'd like to hear from her first really quickly before we open up the (INAUDIBLE).   But we' ve got to find an answer here because it can' t be no swale package, then the only option that we have is we' ve got to get a public safety aide to basically be parked there,  you know, when school drop-off and pick up to make sure that nobody is encroaching or blocking the driveways.   Because,  by the way, we' ve dealt with this before.   We' ve dealt with it at Sunset.   We had multiple meetings on the ground.   I mean,  we had irate neighbors who were telling us, listen,  I couldn' t get out of my driveway for 45 minutes.   People were so desperate to avoid the line on Sunset that they would park their cars,  and then what ended up happening was, you know, I had to wait 45 minutes to go to work or to a doctor' s appointment because I couldn' t get out.  And this is nothing new.  It's just, again,  it' s one of the things that we' re dealing with as being one of the cities that everybody wants to live in and send their kids to school.\n\nMr. Tuyos:  Mr. Mayor, I'm sensitive to the needs of the community in regards to how do you call it, their educational needs for the broader…\n\nMayor Lago:   But you also want quality of life and I respect that.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   But specific to this location,  we' re probably at the point that we shouldn' t have been at because of prior decisions made here with single-family homes that shouldn' t have been schools with no parking.   Yeah,  I mean,  and for me to be given right now a solution that,  hey,  maybe we build a parking garage in this neighborhood,  that will go --  that' s going to go very…\n\nMayor Lago:   That wasn' t my intent.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   I know, I know.\n\nMayor Lago:   My intent was that we need to…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   You understand what I'm saying?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nAgenda Item E-4 - Ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip' s School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre- K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue,  Coral Gables,  Florida;  all other conditions of approval contained in Ordinance No. 3576 shall remain in effect.\n\nMayor Lago:   Find some sort of solutions…\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Yeah.\n\nMayor Lago:   Outside of, you know, to alleviate parking.   And what are the two options?   Three options.   Either you bus people in from somewhere else, you build a surface parking lot.  For that, you got to buy more properties and knock them down,  or you have to build a parking structure. There' s no other way to do this.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   Here' s the only solution I --  one of the…\n\nMayor Lago:   You already have parking issues.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   We already have parking issues,  but we also have single-family home that has been purchased by the school,  which has single-family zoning.   And I'm bringing it to your attention today on this date.  So, go --  let it go on the record,  okay…\n\nMs. Tuyos:   That' s what they' re doing.\n\nMr. Tuyos:   That we do not want this continued expansion of single- family zoning and singlefamily homes,  okay, being built into future classroom space.\n\nMayor Lago:   I want to address one point before we hear from Ms. Russo,  okay.   So,  we can approve today,  moving on to second reading,  but one of the things that I would want is for there to be a real discussion between you and the school' s representative,  Russo,  and that the Manager' s team be engaged on that front.  Because there has to be -- I will not approve this on second reading if we don' t have a solution to, at a minimum --  because we' re not going to find a parking solution today,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ULLIVER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ulliver, an organization involved in discussions regarding expansion of their footprint and required to provide continual documentation on school enrollment as per covenants to show rule compliance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_MANAGER<|>PERSON<|>The City Manager, referenced as a key official involved in reviewing documents and collaborating with colleagues and Ms. Russo to ensure adherence to agreements related to school expansion and neighborhood issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS_RUSSO<|>PERSON<|>Ms. Russo, a school representative involved in discussions with the City Manager and City Commission members regarding school expansion, document submission, and neighborhood concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING_AND_ZONING_BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Planning and Zoning Board, which is requesting cooperation from the client (school) to develop a swale package as part of neighborhood solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNSET<|>PROJECT<|>Sunset, a location where prior meetings were held to address neighborhood parking and driveway blocking issues caused by school-related traffic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR_TUYOS<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Tuyos, a City Commission member expressing sensitivity to community educational needs and concerns about prior decisions allowing schools in single-family home zones without parking.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the City Commission meeting, discussing parking and neighborhood quality of life issues related to school expansion and zoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City Commission, the governing body holding the meeting on January 9, 2024, discussing agenda items including school site plan amendments and zoning issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where agenda item E-4 was discussed regarding amendments to St. Philip's School site plan.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENDA_ITEM_E-4<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda Item E-4, an ordinance of the City Commission amending St. Philip's School site plan approved under Ordinance No. 3576 to replace an existing building with a new pre-K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida; all other conditions of approval in Ordinance No. 3576 remain in effect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE_3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance No. 3576, the original ordinance approving St. Philip's School site plan, which is being amended by Agenda Item E-4 to allow replacement of an existing building with a new pre-K building at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGENDA_ITEM_E-4<|>ORDINANCE_3576<|>Agenda Item E-4 amends Ordinance No. 3576 by replacing an existing building with a new pre-K building at St. Philip's School site, while keeping all other conditions of Ordinance No. 3576 in effect.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>The City Commission held the meeting on January 9, 2024, where Agenda Item E-4 was discussed.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEETING_JANUARY_9_2024<|>AGENDA_ITEM_E-4<|>Agenda Item E-4 was discussed during the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MR_TUYOS<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>Mr. Tuyos and Mayor Lago engaged in dialogue during the meeting about neighborhood parking, school expansion, and zoning issues.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MR_TUYOS<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>Mr. Tuyos is a member of the City Commission participating in the meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_LAGO<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>Mayor Lago presides over the City Commission meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MS_RUSSO<|>CITY_MANAGER<|>Ms. Russo and the City Manager are collaborating to review documents and find solutions related to school expansion and neighborhood concerns.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANNING_AND_ZONING_BOARD<|>ULLIVER<|>The Planning and Zoning Board is requesting cooperation from Ulliver (the client) to develop a swale package as part of neighborhood solutions.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUNSET<|>CITY_COMMISSION<|>Sunset was the location of prior meetings held by the City Commission to address neighborhood parking and driveway blocking issues.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
