This ordinance or resolution establishes the legal framework for raising funds through these bonds, which are secured by the revenues generated from the city's sewage disposal system. The adoption of the ordinance typically follows a public hearing and the approval of a preliminary schedule of rates, fees, and charges related to sewer services. Additionally, the ordinance fixes the initial schedule of these rates, fees, and charges as outlined in Section 2-464 of the City Code. This comprehensive process ensures that the bond issuance is supported by a structured financial plan tied to the sewage disposal systemâ€™s revenue, thereby providing a reliable source of repayment for the bonds.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749762920, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 385, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
