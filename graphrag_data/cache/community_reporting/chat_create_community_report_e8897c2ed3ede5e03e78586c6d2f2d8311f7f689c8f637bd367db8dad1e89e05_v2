The existing building is characterized by old structure and sagging floors, which led to the decision to demolish it and construct a new facility. This replacement is significant as it addresses safety and usability concerns for the property, particularly for the intended use as classrooms for Pre-K 3 and Pre-K 4. The new building will maintain approximately the same size as the existing one but will include modern features such as a multi-purpose room and a covered walkway canopy for security.

This design choice was a direct result of the Board of Architects’ requirement to prevent the building from having an institutional look. The windows’ design was also influenced by a prior condition from the 2001-2003 master plan that prohibited windows on the eastern side of buildings. This condition was challenged and subsequently modified to accommodate the new building’s window design, reflecting a balance between regulatory frameworks and architectural flexibility.
