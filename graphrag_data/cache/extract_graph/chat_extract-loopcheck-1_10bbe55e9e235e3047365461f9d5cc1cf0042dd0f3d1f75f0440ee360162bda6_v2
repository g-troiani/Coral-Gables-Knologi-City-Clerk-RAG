You would all review it and request approval of an amendment to their prior approvals.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   And if we find out that they' ve added a hundred more students or 50 more students,  then what would the City have?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So, they have to -- and maybe the planner can come up, but I think annually they submit an affidavit.   Isn' t that…?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   City Planner,  Jennifer Garcia.   So,  they --  I believe they submit something every single year, every single school year to…\n\nMs. Russo:   I think it's done toward the middle of September.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:  ( INAUDIBLE)  every January.\n\nMs. Russo:   January.\n\nCity Planner\n\nGarcia:   January,  okay.\n\nUnidentified\n\nSpeaker:   We send a letter ( INAUDIBLE).\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Right.\n\nMs. Russo:   Right,  each school has it a little bit differently. I think some have it at the end of September,  but all the schools I've represented that have student limitations provide an annual affidavit on the student enrollment.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   So, it's a viable legal binding agreement.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   Correct.   And if there was a violation,  then we would take action to enforce the covenant is what we would do.  That would be our recourse.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: And I agree,  there are other schools,  I know the charter school on Segovia,  when they were approved,  all the schools have their limitations.\n\nMs. Russo:   Gulliver,  St. Thomas also have student…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   But I know people are watching,  they want to know, well, is it binding? So, that' s good to know.  In terms of the footprint of the school,  Madam City Attorney,  when 2002 there were agreements,  things that were approved,  was the footprint of the school limited in any documentation?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  So, there is a site plan that was approved.   This is one of the buildings that is part of that site plan that it was --  the existing structure is smaller than what they are proposing. They' re proposing to demolish the existing building within the site plan and construct a larger building.   Is that accurate?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   How about the building itself?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   The building itself is the same size.   The extra square footage comes from the now enclosed concrete walkway for security purposes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I'm talking about the campus.\n\nMs. Russo:   Those of you with small children know that you can' t -- you don' t want access to children.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So,  this -my understanding is that this request does not change the boundaries of the site plan.\n\nMs. Russo:   That is correct.   The boundaries remain the same.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   My follow-up question,  and I totally understand having a property that people can --  visitors can stay, you know, close to the school,  the church.  When they acquired that property --  and I totally support and understand having it for guests --  did that change the footprint of the campus,  or is that something they should have notified the City that we' ve added a property?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  No, they have a right to purchase and own property.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   It has --  it is not connected to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.   Right, and no, I just want to check off the boxes.\n\nMs. Russo:   Yeah,  to connect it, let' s just say,  we' re not going to do it, but let' s just say,  it would have to come before DRC, it would have to go before the Planning and Zoning Board, and it would be a change in land use and a change in zoning and a major amendment to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Like I said,  the fact that you' re not having classes or events,  it's --  I understand the need for it.  I just don' t want to cross that line at any point because it' s not good for the school,  the church,  or the City in general,  or obviously,  the residents.   I totally support the direction my colleagues are headed with between first and second reading.   I personally suggest don' t bring this back on second reading unless there' s a true agreement because we don' t want to repeat today.   And with regards to signage,  the residential permit,  I asked the City Manager,  that area does qualify for it, but again,  things have to be enforced and we all know because we have traffic circles,  we have speed bumps,  sometimes physical additions are required because people just regardless of what the sign says,  do whatever they want.   So, I'm in support of the direction my colleagues are headed with this first to second reading.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay,  so we can close this out between first and second,  if I'm getting the vibe of what this Commission is headed. So,  we' re going to move forward on first reading.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item referenced in discussion, likely related to a specific ordinance or resolution under consideration during the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024)##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST READING<|>MEETING<|>Stage of legislative process mentioned by Mayor Lago indicating initial consideration of an ordinance or resolution)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECOND READING<|>MEETING<|>Stage of legislative process mentioned by Commissioner Menendez and Mayor Lago indicating subsequent consideration of an ordinance or resolution)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY ATTORNEY SUÁREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney providing legal advice and clarifications regarding amendments, site plans, and enforcement of covenants during the City Commission meeting)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>City Commissioner actively questioning and providing input on school agreements, site plans, and legislative process during the meeting)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY PLANNER GARCIA<|>PERSON<|>City Planner Jennifer Garcia providing information about annual affidavit submissions related to student enrollment and school limitations)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS.
