And so,  for all the many years I've lived here,  I have replanted my swale,  like I'm sure many of you have.   I've endured neighbors doing construction projects joyfully,  and I'm happy to be in a community that works together so that we can live together in harmony. I will say that St.  Philip' s is in a neighborhood that' s in high demand for parking and we struggle with the same issues that our neighbors do and those who want to attend and use the glorious park that has been provided by the City.   It has only increased and become more challenging. And as Ms. Russo pointed out,  we continue to ask people to rideshare when we have big events,  whether it's a large funeral,  whether it' s a big event for the school.   We ask people to observe ' No Parking'  signs, to be mindful of the neighbors' driveways for their own safety.   And we try in every way we can to be a good and gracious neighbor.   And we' re happy to work with the City and with all of our neighbors and all the constituents to try to find reasonable solutions.   But I strongly believe that asking St. Philip' s\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nto take on in perpetuity to plant and maintain a non-adjacent neighbor swale is not only unfair, it's unneighborly. And so,  we' re here to really ask your permission to build a new building for our youngest learners.   And I hope you will support us.   Thank you.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Octavio\n\nSanturio.\n\nMs. Russo:   No, he' s --  no.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Cecilia Slesnick.\n\nCecelia Slesnick:   Good morning,  Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, Commissioners,  everyone on the dais. Cecilia Slesnick,  721 Navarre,  Coral Gables,  and many Coral Gables addresses before that.   As nearly a 23-year-long parishioner of St. Philip' s and a lifelong resident of the City of Coral Gables, I know the issue of parking.   I know the issue of swale,  a word which,  by the way, is constantly autocorrected if you' ve ever tried to spell it.   And I know how special our church community is at St.  Philip' s.   So,  as a parishioner,  I understand the challenges. As Ms. Russo pointed out,  the enrollment at the school is not going to be increasing.   And as you saw by the picture,  actually I think aesthetically it' s going to be a nice improvement to the block and will make it all feel much more cohesive,  which I appreciate as a realtor.   The second thing, as was noted,  is that the swales are public property.   And I remind that to my neighbors in my neighborhood.   And as I'm selling homes in Coral Gables,  I remind the homeowners that the swales are to be kept by you, but they are public property.   So, that' s where your visitors should park when they come to see you.  If you have deliveries,  if you have people coming to work at your home, that' s where they should park. They should not be blocking the sidewalks,  and they certainly shouldn' t be blocking --  parking in the streets like you do in other municipalities.   So, as a nonprofit,  as a church community,  which I know many of you on the dais can appreciate as churchgoers,  and all of you go to churches in this vicinity,  you can understand that it feels a little unfair.   Public parking is a bigger issue,  right? Especially on the footprint that we' re looking at.  The most welcome improvements to Salvadore Park.   Speaking as someone who swung on those rusty swings in the 1980s, and if you did, you' ll remember that they swayed a lot and it was really fun to see how high up you could go and not land in a tennis court.  So, the improvements are welcome.   My children love them.  Every Sunday when I park to go to church,  I hear the ping and the pong of the pickleballs and the tennis courts, and my golden retriever has loved the dog park.  So, all of these improvements bring not only joy and excitement to the City, but obviously,  it creates a little bit of congestion that everyone in the neighborhood has to work with, right?  The neighbors on Venetia,  the neighbors on Columbus,  all of the neighbors have to.  So, although I'm not speaking on behalf of the School and Community Relations Committee,  you all know that I am a member of the School and Community Relations Committee,  right?  SCRC,  School and Community Relations Committee.   And I'm not speaking on their behalf,  but because I'm a member and have been,  I know that every school in our community has its challenges with our ever-growing,  ever-evolving,  and ever-brightening city. So, let' s just keep that in mind as we go through this first reading and we move on to the second reading that every decision that' s made in and around schools potentially sets a precedent for all\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nof the other schools,  right?
