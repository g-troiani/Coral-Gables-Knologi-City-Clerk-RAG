These newspapers serve as official channels for disseminating notices of violations, summonses for hearings, statements of costs, assessments, forfeiture complaint notices, and ordinance adoptions, as mandated by Florida statutes (specifically F.S. ch. 50) and local city ordinances. Traditionally, newspapers of general circulation have been the primary media outlets used by municipalities like the City of Coral Gables to publish legal notices and advertisements, ensuring public awareness and compliance with statutory notification requirements.
