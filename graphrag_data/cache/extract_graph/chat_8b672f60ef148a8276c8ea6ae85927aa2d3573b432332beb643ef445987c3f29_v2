text document from the City of Coral Gables, identify all entities and their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nEntity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION\nText: \"Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed. This is Ordinance 2024-01.\"\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, which is the same as Ordinance 2024-01 and amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, also known as agenda item E-1, which amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same as<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Real Data-\nEntity types: agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project\nText: hearing will be held on the request before the City Commission. A notification containing this information shall also be mailed by the City Clerk at least ten ( 10) days prior to the public hearing to the property owners of record, as well as property owners within a radius of one thousand ( 1, 000) feet of the property described in the request, if the request is site-specific.\n\nDevelopment Review Officer report and recommendation. The report and recommendation of the Development Review Officer shall be submitted to the City Manager based upon the requirements of this Article, shall be limited to the proposed zoning and land use approvals, shall be advisory in nature, and shall not be binding in the approval proceedings. The form of the recommendation and the time for receipt of the recommendation shall be as established by the City Manager\n\nCity Attorney Recommendation. After receipt and consideration of the Development Review Officer recommendation, the City Attorney, in consultation with the City Manager, shall submit a recommendation to the City Commission with regard to approval of the Government Settlement. The City Attorney9s recommendations with regard to the proposed land use and zoning approvals in the proposed Government Settlement shall be based upon the requirements of this Article.\n\n## Section 15- 102.
