From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

By the way,  thank you for being here and reviewing the proposal.  I appreciate that.  I know you' ve got a lot on your plate and that was sent to you late. I thought it was sent to you before.  I would have removed it off the agenda if we weren' t ready for it, my fault. I apologize.  I know you guys rushed it to take a look at that. So, moving onto item F2. You want to just kind of put Pittman Park to rest.  I think we have a graph there,  not a graph, excuse me, a diagram.  We can show Pittman Park, something that I would love one day to be able to embark on,  but I'm just a little bit concerned about whether it' s even viable.  Due to several different things that are kind of in conflict;  number one, the neighboring building,  the alley, trying to close that street and connect the park.  Is there anybody from staff that can show this? Do we have anybody from staff?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  the Public Works Director is - he' s coming up now. I'm sure he' s coming up from the conference room.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. We' ll come back to it.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  He' s right here.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  He' s running up the stairs.\n\nMayor Lago:  Its okay. Caught you off guard there.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Catch your breath.\n\nMayor Lago:  I gave a preamble that this is not a -  this is a beautiful project,  if we can get it to work, but its not really going to work.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: My apologies.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Its okay. We' re just trying to make sure you get your steps in.\n\nLaughter]\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Yes. Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  So,  Mr. Director,  I was explaining that Pittman,  the idea of bringing Pittman Park into Giralda is a beautiful thing, along with the surface parking lot, but there are many conflicts.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Correct.\n\nMayor Lago: The building, the alley, and it just kind of makes the idea and concept a little difficult.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Public Works Director Diaz: So just a little back story.  The current plan, which is not funded due to cost,  its some improvements to the parking lot behind the Giralda Plaza to match the existing pattern,  right. There are also to be some electrical improvements that will allow that park to on an event put some bollards close off the parking lot. I think it's some upgrade electrical so you could potentially put some, maybe some musical equipment,  that' s the original plan. This plan has been completed;  it's done.  The current estimated -  the last estimate that we have for this, which goes back to March of 2023 was $ 940,000,  so obviously, we haven' t been able to fund this.  So subsequently,  there was a discussion about the potential of joining Pittman Park with the parking lot and obviously there' s, like the Mayor mentioned,  there' s a number of conflicts,  especially you do have an alley,  which we need to make sure that we maintain access to, and the building next door has several entrances and exits that need to be maintained.  So, in a kind of general form, you know, there' s a potential to close the space in between,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>F-2<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item F-2 discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning an update regarding Pittman Park, including challenges related to connecting the park with the neighboring building, alley, and surface parking lot.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PITTMAN_PARK<|>PROJECT<|>Pittman Park project discussed in agenda item F-2, involving potential improvements and connection to Giralda Plaza parking lot, with challenges including alley access and neighboring building entrances.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_OF_CORAL_GABLES_CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_01_09_2024<|>MEETING<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, at City Commission Chambers, 405 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, FL, where agenda item F-2 was discussed.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCE_LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Vince Lago, Mayor of the City of Coral Gables, sponsor of agenda item F-2 and speaker during the discussion of Pittman Park.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHONDA_ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Rhonda Anderson, Vice Mayor of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELISSA_CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Melissa Castro, Commissioner of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARIEL_FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Ariel Fernandez, Commissioner of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIRK_MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Kirk Menendez, Commissioner of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISTINA_SUAREZ<|>PERSON<|>Cristina Su√°rez, City Attorney of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER_IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>Peter Iglesias, City Manager of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting and participant in the discussion of agenda item F-2.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLY_URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>Billy Urquia, City Clerk of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERMES_DIAZ<|>PERSON<|>Hermes Diaz, Public Works Director of the City of Coral Gables, present at the January 9, 2024 City Commission meeting and speaker providing details about the Pittman Park project during agenda item F-2 discussion.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-2<|>PITTMAN_PARK<|>Agenda item F-2 concerns an update regarding the Pittman Park project, as explicitly stated in the discussion and transcript.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_OF_CORAL_GABLES_CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING_01_09_2024<|>F-2<|>Agenda item F-2 was discussed during the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCE_LAGO<|>F-2<|>Mayor Vince Lago sponsored and spoke about agenda item F-2 during the meeting.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER_IGLESIAS<|>F-2<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias participated in the discussion of agenda item F-2 and introduced Public Works Director Diaz to speak.<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMES_DIAZ<|>F-2<|>Public Works Director Hermes Diaz provided detailed information about the Pittman Park project during agenda item F-2 discussion.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RHONDA_ANDERSON<|>F-2<|>Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson was present and engaged during the discussion of agenda item F-2.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARIEL_FERNANDEZ<|>F-2<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez was present and participated during the discussion of agenda item F-2.<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCE_LAGO<|>PITTMAN_PARK<|>Mayor Lago expressed his views and concerns about the viability of the Pittman Park project.<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HERMES_DIAZ<|>PITTMAN_PARK<|>Public Works Director Diaz described the current plan and challenges related to the Pittman Park project.<|>10)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
