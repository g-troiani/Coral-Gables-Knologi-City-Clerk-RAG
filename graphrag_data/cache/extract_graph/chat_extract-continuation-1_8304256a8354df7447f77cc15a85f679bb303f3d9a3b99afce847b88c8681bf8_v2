( Sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez)\n\nMayor Lago:  Moving onto E-7.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez: E-7 is an Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code, Creating Section 5-314 ' Window and Hurricane Shutters' to regulate the closure of window and hurricane shutters and amending the City Code, Chapter 1-General Provisions,  Section 1-7 entitled ' Penalties'  to provide a penalty for the closure of window and hurricane shutters outside of the hurricane season;  providing for severability clause,\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nrepealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date. This is a public hearing item. Assistant City Attorney Gus Ceballos will present the ordinance.\n\nMayor Lago: May I ask you a quick question Mr. City Attorney,  because I know I've had residents call me before or send an email in regard to code enforcement issues,  their neighbors have their windows closed,  shutters.  How have we addressed this before with Code Enforcement when those individuals have been turned into Code Enforcement.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Ceballos:  Typically,  Code Enforcement will go out and our code doesn' t prohibit the closure of the shutters.  There are other parts of our city code that may apply to abandoned property,  if you have all the windows shuddered.  There are other characteristics to get the meat in order to fall under that definition of an abandoned property and that' s a different enforcement mechanism. This creates a simpler enforcement mechanism specifically for the purpose of shutters.  We know it happens all the time. People put them up and then the next thing you know its February and people still have their shutters up. Frankly, for whatever reason whether its laziness or they just haven' t had the chance or the time, this is an enforcement mechanism that will address that particular item independent of all the other issues with an abandoned property.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, what they do is, they basically have a conversation with the property owner and speak to them about opening up their windows.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  May I say something.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Its also a building code issue,  because you need ventilation,  and you need egress.\n\nMayor Lago:  Of course.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  So, you' ve got two building code issues where you have an unsafe structure at that point.\n\nMayor Lago:  But my question was, how would we address it, because I know that residents have sent us emails over the years saying listen,  my neighbor doesn' t have one window open in their house,  its all shuddered,  how have we addressed that.  I've even had it on the garage,  and they' ve complied through Code Enforcement.  How did we get it done before?\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Ceballos:  So, I personally have never had to deal with that particular issue before. What I can do is I can find out from Code Enforcement how they' ve handled it in the past.  I can let you know. I can look into it for you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Okay.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Isn' t it also a fire code issue?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Just to give - that' s one of my major concerns and the reason that I'm putting this in here.  I know that it is a major fire issue.  I've driven through parts of North Gables where you have homes that have shutters on every single opening that' s visible from the street.  I also think we are trying to keep a look for our city, we go through this lengthy approval process to make sure that homes look good and look appropriate for Code Enforcement,  and this is one thing. I understand during hurricane season sometimes you have that first storm that comes up, you put up your shutters,  and it is cumbersome and difficult to remove them.  We have folks who don' t necessarily have the ability to do it themselves and have to rely on family members.  So,  what I wanted to do was give a buffer so that you have through the end of hurricane season and possibly a storm that lingers after hurricane season\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-7<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda Item E-7, a public hearing item discussed at the City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning a proposed ordinance amending the zoning code related to window and hurricane shutters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>ORDINANCE<|>An ordinance proposed by the City Commission of Coral Gables to amend the Official Zoning Code by creating Section 5-314 'Window and Hurricane Shutters' to regulate the closure of window and hurricane shutters, and amending Chapter 1-General Provisions, Section 1-7 'Penalties' to provide penalties for closure of shutters outside hurricane season; includes severability clause, repealer provision, codification, and effective date; sponsored by Commissioner Ariel Fernandez)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9 2024<|>MEETING<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, at City Commission Chambers, 405 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, FL, where Agenda Item E-7 was discussed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINCE LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Vince Lago, presiding officer of the City of Coral Gables City Commission during the January 9, 2024 meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHONDA ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission present at the January 9, 2024 meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELISSA CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Melissa Castro, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission present at the January 9, 2024 meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARIEL FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission who sponsored the ordinance related to window and hurricane shutters discussed in Agenda Item E-7)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIRK MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Kirk Menendez, member of the City of Coral Gables City Commission present at the January 9, 2024 meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISTINA SUAREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Cristina Suárez, legal advisor to the City of Coral Gables, providing explanation of the ordinance during the meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias, city official providing input on building code issues related to window and hurricane shutters during the meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BILLY URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Billy Urquia, responsible for official records of the City of Coral Gables City Commission meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUS CEBALLOS<|>PERSON<|>Assistant City Attorney Gus Ceballos, presenting the ordinance and providing legal explanations during the City Commission meeting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City Commission of Coral Gables, the governing body responsible for legislative decisions including the ordinance discussed in Agenda Item E-7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-7<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>Agenda Item E-7 is the agenda item under which Ordinance E-7 was presented and discussed<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9 2024<|>E-7<|>Agenda Item E-7 was discussed during the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9 2024<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>The City Commission convened the meeting on January 9, 2024<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>The City Commission is the legislative body proposing and considering Ordinance E-7<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARIEL FERNANDEZ<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez sponsored Ordinance E-7<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINCE LAGO<|>E-7<|>Mayor Vince Lago led the discussion and moved the meeting onto Agenda Item E-7<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRISTINA SUAREZ<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>City Attorney Cristina Suárez explained the details of Ordinance E-7 during the meeting<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUS CEBALLOS<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>Assistant City Attorney Gus Ceballos presented Ordinance E-7 and provided legal clarifications<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETER IGLESIAS<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias provided input related to building code issues relevant to the ordinance on window and hurricane shutters<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RHONDA ANDERSON<|>ORDINANCE E-7<|>Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson participated in the discussion regarding Ordinance E-7, raising questions about fire code issues<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARIEL FERNANDEZ<|>E-7<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez discussed concerns and rationale for the ordinance under Agenda Item E-7<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
