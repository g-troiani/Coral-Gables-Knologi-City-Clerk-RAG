So,  the criteria to request a parking reduction from the Commission would be half-a-mile from the major transit stop. It would have to be an accessible route from one quarter mile of that property of the development and a major transit stop. The Commission would consider any impact that parking reductions may have on a neighborhood and making sure its compatible with the surrounding area and the parking reductions are based on the size of the property.  So, a greater,  larger property would have less reduction and a larger reduction would be for the smaller properties and that would be to discourage larger,  taller buildings that may be out of character with the surrounding area.  And the Commission can also grant any rate of parking reductions that' s less than 6,000 square feet.  And that' s all I have.  So, staff is here, legal is here to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have one question on accessible route.  Let' s say that accessibility is defined as ADA compliant accessibility.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  Yes. So, I think we have, and I can bring it right now that the ordinance had,  sidewalks,  ramps,  crosswalks,  any way that' s easily to get to need proposed development to the major transit stop.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Okay.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I only have a question I brought up at agenda review.  You mentioned trolley stops and bus stops as triggering the need for this legislation or compatibility and I think in the discussion recently the county took away one of our, several bus stops or bus routes that we normally have.  So,  we' ll be passing legislation connected to particular bus stops when bus stops now, we know come and go, but once we approve this reduction in parking, even if those bus stops disappear down the road,  we still have the impact of today' s legislation.  I know we' re bound or required to do it, but its sort of not well thought out in Tallahassee,  but maybe that' s the norm these days.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  That' s the consideration the Commission makes if there' s a proposed development that once a reduction of parking maybe there' s a line that you think is not used that often,  maybe the concern that the county may remove it in the future, that' s up to your discretion.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  Right.  In each instance it will come to you all to consider and approve if that' s the will of the Commission to the parking reduction based on a consideration of the impact of the development on parking and the character of each particular neighborhood.\n\nPlanning Official Garcia:  And I just want to clarify that the ordinance doesn' t tie a consideration to a specific bus stop,  but it just defines a criteria to determine what a mass transit stop is, and so, if a bus stop is eliminated,  for example,  it wouldn' t require an amendment to the ordinance or to the zoning code, that criteria remain static.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that feedback.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you for the presentation.  You gave a good explanation of what we' re facing with Live Local. Any comments from the public.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Yes sir. We have a member of the public on Zoom who would like to speak is Aky Fernandez.\n\nMayor Lago:  The floor is yours. Good afternoon.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes sir.\n\nMr. Fernandez:  Okay. Good afternoon,  everyone,  Aky Fernandez,  1542 Mendavia.  I'm a resident of the city lifelong.  Also, an architect and a builder.  Happy with this proposed legislation.  I think it' s a step in the right direction.  The only thing that I will say after sort of reading through it, you know frankly,  the reductions that are being proposed while I think they are well-intentioned,  I actually don' t think it' s going to go a significant way in terms of making the final product more affordable.  To be frank,  they need to be more generous,  the parking reductions,  if we' re actually going to see some of this inventory get built. I'll give you an example.  I have a project that I'm working on now, 10,000 square- foot project, we can fit anywhere between 15 to 16 parking spaces on that parcel,  surface parking.  You know, under this legislation,  a ten percent reduction would be a space and-a-half, maybe two spaces,  if I get a good interpretation.  That' s not necessarily going to make a huge difference in terms of how affordable the units are going to be.  I think maybe something that would help sort of give some reference is actually a local precedent that we have in Miami-Dade County, there' s something called the Urban Center Program;  and within the Urban Center Program sort of very similar along the lines of trying to give parking discounts for workforce housing along transit,  they basically -  I'm happy to share it with the Clerk and maybe he can distribute it to you all. They have a tiered system which basically gives a by-right workforce reduction of 25 percent and then when you are building within 500 feet of a rail station,  you can actually qualify for up to 100 percent reduction and then it goes in terms of, and then it reduces based on how far you are from a bus stop, etc., goes all the way to ten percent reduction.  And then the way that they do it in terms of parcel size is that parcels less than 15,\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Commission<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City Commission, responsible for considering and approving parking reduction requests based on criteria such as proximity to major transit stops, neighborhood impact, and property size.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ordinance<|>ORDINANCE<|>An ordinance discussed by Planning Official Garcia that defines criteria for parking reductions, including accessible routes to major transit stops, sidewalks, ramps, and crosswalks, and does not require amendment if bus stops are eliminated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting<|>MEETING<|>A meeting of the City Commission where parking reduction legislation and related topics were discussed, including public comments and presentations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, a member of the City Commission who inquired about the definition of accessible routes in the ordinance, specifically regarding ADA compliance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Planning Official Garcia<|>PERSON<|>Planning Official Garcia, a city staff member who explained the ordinance's criteria for parking reductions, including accessible routes and the static nature of mass transit stop definitions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a City Commissioner who raised concerns about the legislation's reliance on bus stops that may be removed and the impact of such changes on parking reductions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Suarez, who clarified that the Commission will consider and approve parking reductions based on development impact and neighborhood character.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>City Clerk Urquia<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Urquia, who facilitated public participation during the City Commission Meeting, including introducing public speaker Aky Fernandez.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Aky Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Aky Fernandez, a lifelong resident of Coral Gables, architect, and builder, who spoke in favor of the proposed parking reduction legislation but suggested the reductions should be more generous to impact affordability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Urban Center Program<|>PROJECT<|>A local precedent program in Miami-Dade County referenced by Aky Fernandez, offering tiered parking reductions for workforce housing near transit, including up to 100 percent reduction within 500 feet of a rail station.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Ordinance<|>Vice Mayor Anderson asked about the definition of accessible routes in the ordinance, specifically regarding ADA compliance, showing direct engagement with the ordinance's content.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Planning Official Garcia<|>Ordinance<|>Planning Official Garcia explained the ordinance's criteria for parking reductions, including accessible routes and the static nature of mass transit stop definitions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Ordinance<|>Commissioner Menendez raised concerns about the ordinance's reliance on bus stops that may be removed, affecting parking reductions.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Attorney Suarez<|>Commission<|>City Attorney Suarez stated that the Commission will consider and approve parking reductions based on development impact and neighborhood character.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>City Clerk Urquia<|>City Commission Meeting<|>City Clerk Urquia facilitated public participation during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Aky Fernandez<|>City Commission Meeting<|>Aky Fernandez spoke during the City Commission Meeting, providing public comment on the proposed legislation.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Aky Fernandez<|>Urban Center Program<|>Aky Fernandez referenced the Urban Center Program as a local precedent for parking reductions related to workforce housing near transit.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
