This proximity imposes constraints on design and feasibility, as any development or modification in the park area must consider the impact on the neighboring property. The ownership by two individuals adds a layer of complexity in negotiations and planning, as their interests and concerns must be addressed to move forward with any project.

Its position complicates potential development plans, as it restricts access and usable space. The alley's presence requires careful consideration in project planning to avoid conflicts with existing infrastructure and property boundaries.
