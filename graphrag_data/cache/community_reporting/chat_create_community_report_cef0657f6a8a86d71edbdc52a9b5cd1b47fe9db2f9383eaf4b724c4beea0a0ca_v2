This amendment authorizes the replacement of an existing building with a new pre-K building located at 1109 Andalusia Avenue, Coral Gables. All other conditions of approval contained in the original Ordinance No. 3576 remain in full effect. This amendment was recommended for approval with conditions by the Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) on November 3, 2023, with a unanimous 7-0 vote. The ordinance was discussed at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, and includes provisions for an effective date.\n\nThe second ordinance, referenced by document number 23-6566, involves the approval of a Planned Area Development (PAD) pursuant to Zoning Code Article 14, Section 14-206, for a proposed Publix grocery store and liquor store. This development is planned for the property legally described as Lots 1 through 48, Block 8, Coral Gables Crafts Section, located at 2551 Le Jeune Road, Coral Gables, Florida.
