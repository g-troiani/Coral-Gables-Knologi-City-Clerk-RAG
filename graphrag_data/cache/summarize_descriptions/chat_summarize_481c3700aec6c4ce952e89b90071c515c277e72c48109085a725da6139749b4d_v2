Referenced by Aky Fernandez, this program provides significant parking discounts based on proximity to transit options and parcel size. Specifically, it offers a by-right 25% parking reduction for workforce housing, with reductions increasing up to 100% for developments located within 500 feet of a rail station. The program also features graduated parking reductions that decrease with distance from bus stops. Additionally, the size of the parcel influences the level of parking reduction: parcels under 15,000 square feet are eligible for up to a 100% reduction, parcels between 15,000 and 30,000 square feet receive a 60% reduction, and parcels over 30,000 square feet qualify for a 20% reduction. Overall, the Urban Center Program strategically incentivizes workforce housing near transit hubs by providing substantial parking relief tailored to location and parcel size.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840856, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 546, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
