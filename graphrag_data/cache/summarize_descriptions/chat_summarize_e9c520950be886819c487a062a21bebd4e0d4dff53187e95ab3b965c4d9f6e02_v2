One example of a resolution is the City Commission's approval of the conditional use review for the site plan of the Publix grocery and liquor store, demonstrating its role in land use and development decisions. Additionally, the Coral Gables Historic Preservation Board has passed a formal resolution requesting the City Commission to halt the removal of silver streetlights and to adopt a standardized streetlight design, highlighting the resolution’s function in preserving the city’s historic character. Furthermore, a resolution by the City Commission can also serve as an administrative directive, such as instructing the City Clerk and City Manager to schedule bimonthly presentations and protocol ceremonies.
