This meeting represents a critical point of public involvement and transparency in the regulatory process, allowing stakeholders to voice concerns and provide input on zoning regulations that directly impact development and community planning. The meeting's role underscores the participatory nature of local governance in Coral Gables and highlights the importance of community feedback in shaping zoning policies [Data: Entities (1077); Relationships (1663)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Zoning Code as the central regulatory framework\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The City of Coral Gables zoning code is the foundational regulatory framework governing land use, development scale, and density within the city. It encompasses key parameters such as Floor Area Ratio (FAR), open space requirements, and parking mandates. The zoning code is primarily considered by the City Commission, which exercises oversight and decision-making authority, except in cases where the Live Local Act preempts local regulations. This central role of the zoning code establishes it as the pivotal entity around which other regulatory components and community discussions revolve [Data: Entities (810); Relationships (1663, 1212, 1213, 1214)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Floor Area Ratio (FAR) controls development scale\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is a critical zoning parameter within the Coral Gables zoning code that directly controls the scale of development. With a maximum FAR of 3.5 in the mixed-use district, this regulation limits the total building floor area relative to the size of the lot, thereby influencing building height and density. FAR serves as a quantitative measure to balance growth and maintain community character, making it a key lever in urban planning and development control [Data: Entities (811); Relationships (1212)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Open space requirements ensure ground-level community amenities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Open space requirements are embedded within the zoning code to mandate the provision of accessible ground-level open areas in new developments. These requirements aim to enhance livability, environmental quality, and aesthetic appeal within the city. The City Commission considers these open space mandates as part of its regulatory review process, ensuring that developments contribute positively to the public realm and community well-being. This aspect of the zoning code reflects a commitment to sustainable and community-friendly urban design [Data: Entities (812); Relationships (1213)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Parking requirements influence development density and accessibility\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Parking requirements form another essential component of the Coral Gables zoning code, impacting both the scale and density of developments. These regulations determine the minimum number of parking spaces that must be provided, which affects land use efficiency and transportation planning. Discussions around parking requirements also consider recent legislative changes, such as parking reduction legislation and the Live Local Act, which may modify or preempt local parking mandates. This dynamic regulatory environment highlights the complexity of balancing development needs with accessibility and urban mobility [Data: Entities (813); Relationships (1214)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Interconnectedness of zoning code components\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The zoning code's components—FAR, open space, and parking requirements—are interrelated and collectively shape the development landscape of Coral Gables. Each element influences the others; for example, parking requirements can affect available open space, and FAR limits impact building massing that relates to open space provision. The City Commission's role in considering these components holistically ensures that development proposals meet multiple regulatory objectives simultaneously. This interconnectedness necessitates careful policy coordination and stakeholder engagement to achieve balanced urban growth [Data: Relationships (1212, 1213, 1214)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Live Local Act's influence on local zoning regulations\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Live Local Act is a legislative framework that can preempt certain local zoning regulations in Coral Gables, affecting how the City Commission applies the zoning code.
