The amendment proposes uniform restrictions on sign sizes across various zoning districts, including residential districts (SFR, MF1, MF2, MF3, MF4) and mixed-use districts (MX1, MX2, MX3).

It specifically targets Article 11, Section 11-107, which governs signage related to the sale, lease, or rental of properties. This ordinance seeks to impose consistent regulations on sign sizes across different zoning districts, reflecting a legislative intent to standardize and possibly reduce visual clutter in the cityscape. The centrality of Agenda Item E-8 is underscored by its direct relationships with both residential and mixed-use zoning districts, as well as its equivalence to Ordinance E-8, indicating its formal legislative status [Data: Entities (893); Relationships (1278, 1279, 1280)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Sign size restrictions in residential zoning districts\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The residential zoning districts—SFR, MF1, MF2, MF3, and MF4—are directly impacted by Agenda Item E-8 through proposed sign size limitations. The ordinance restricts signs in these districts to a maximum of 40 square inches, with an allowance for an additional bottom sign containing specific language. This regulation aims to maintain a uniform and modest signage presence in residential areas, likely to preserve neighborhood aesthetics and reduce visual distractions.

This change represents a substantial tightening of signage regulations in mixed-use areas, which may affect commercial visibility and marketing strategies.
