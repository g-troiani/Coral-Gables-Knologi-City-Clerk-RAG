This permit is typically valid for less than one year from the date of issuance but may be extended upon approval by the relevant agencies and submission of a written extension request. To obtain the permit, applicants—often certified contractors—must meet specific conditions, including the submission of detailed construction plans, payment of required fees, posting a performance bond to ensure project completion, and providing certification of engineering supervision throughout the construction process.

The department reviews proposed construction plans, conducts investigations, and makes recommendations to the city commission prior to public hearings on permit applications. Upon approval by the city commission and relevant agencies, the department issues construction permits and ensures compliance with all permit requirements. This oversight includes establishing construction standards, determining appropriate performance bond amounts, requiring bond postings, and supervising engineering certifications throughout the construction process.
