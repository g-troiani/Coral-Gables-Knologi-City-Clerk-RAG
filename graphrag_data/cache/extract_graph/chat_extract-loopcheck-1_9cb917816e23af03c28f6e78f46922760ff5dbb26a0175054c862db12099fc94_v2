Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

I think it's a place where we could focus on the individuals and focus on those that are being recognized and making sure that they are properly recognized,  and the focus of the Commission during Commission meetings is Commission meetings. I've had several Commission meetings since August,  where the presentation and protocols have been close to an hour and forty-five minutes,  and that' s time that could have been focused on the residents who are in the room waiting for their items to be called up. In some cases,  time certain items that weren' t called up on time certain times, because we weren' t able to get to them on time, and we' ve had at least one instance where a member of the Commission was interrupted because another person had to leave the room and we wanted to make sure that they spoke.  We wouldn' t have gotten to that point had we had a specific ceremony for our employees and for the presentation and protocol and that' s the reason that I'm moving forward with this today.\n\nMayor Lago: But I think you also have to also come to terms and it' s the same situation we' ve had in the past with other decisions this Commission has made.  Let' s test the waters with the employees,  okay.  The employees still vote one way,  we' re going to vote against the employees. For example,  the same thing we were talking about the possibility of doing November elections on -  let' s do November elections,  let' s get the pulse of the community and let' s vote on it. Now we don' t want to vote on it. To me, I just think that it's - you may want that, and I understand that, but at the end of the day, the employees who are the ones being recognized are the ones saying we prefer to be in the Commission Chambers.  Honor our request.  If it was the other way around,  205 people were against it, I'd say listen,  let' s move forward with what the employee wants.  I don' t have an issue with it. It's not the first time that we changed gears on issues,  but I just think, with all due respect,  I think it's more agenda- driven than it is actually driven to benefit the employees.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  I commend you for bringing this back. Thank you very much. I thought this was a lost item. I sincerely think that the way that the survey was worded was not the best outcome, because I don' t think the words,  the questions were to really make the employees understand that this was something special for them and as far as me, I could pledge to be there every single time in any award ceremony, so that makes it any more special. I don' t know if the rest of the\n\nCommission is going to be there. I'm pretty sure most of us will be there and it will be even more special.  So, with all my heart I support this.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  My question is for the administration for the Clerk' s office,  because I think this occurred,  this issue came up because right after the elections we were having an hourand-a-half,  two-hour presentations in protocol section and it was meeting after meeting after meeting,  and we were here 9, 10, 11 hours at the end of the day, and how can -  I'm looking for solutions.  How can we better manage that situation.  Are we the only city that has protocols before the Commission meetings?  Do some have it at noon? I'm looking for something other than one or the other. Is there a hybrid? - because an hour-and- a-half, two hours which everybody is deserving, the people that are recognized,  obviously today was a perfect example,  but why are we having an hour-and-a-half to two-hour protocols when there are folks with items that we need to get to.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And to answer your question,  Commissioner,  this would still allow for certain items to come before the Commission on the date. This would not preclude us from having presentations and protocols during this meeting.  It would move so that items that are known to be at a certain time and our recognition of our employees to have a special ceremony to recognize them.  So, it is a hybrid which we worked out from the conversations that came about during our initial Commission meeting.  Originally,  the resolution that I had presented was everything would be moved to this ceremony.  This is more of a hybrid based on the input that was gathered during the Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Commissioner Menendez,  I want to give you another opportunity.  Excuse me.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You' re a little funny sometimes but continue.  Another opportunity.  Go. I'm listening.\n\nMayor Lago:  Another opportunity to kind of see it another way.  When Mayor Valdes- Fauli was here,  we used to start the Commission meeting earlier and it was seamless,  and it wasn' t an issue. We had it downstairs.  I think people enjoyed it. It wasn' t an issue. We started 30-45 minutes early. We got here probably at 9:15 and we moved forward pretty quickly.  For some reason I thought that maybe being outside pushed the protocol documents faster,  maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like it was\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Commission Meetings<|>MEETING<|>Commission meetings held by the City of Coral Gables where presentations and protocols take place, sometimes lasting up to an hour and forty-five minutes, impacting the time available for residents' items to be addressed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commission<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The governing body of the City of Coral Gables, consisting of Commissioners including Castro, Menendez, Fernandez, and Mayor Lago, responsible for decision-making and conducting meetings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Castro<|>PERSON<|>A member of the City of Coral Gables Commission who supports holding award ceremonies for employees and pledges to attend every single time, emphasizing the importance of recognition.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>PERSON<|>A member of the City of Coral Gables Commission concerned about the length of presentations and protocols during Commission meetings and seeking solutions to better manage meeting time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>A member of the City of Coral Gables Commission who supports a hybrid approach to employee recognition ceremonies, allowing presentations and protocols during meetings but also having a special ceremony for employee recognition.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>The Mayor of Coral Gables who comments on employee preferences for recognition location, past practices of starting meetings earlier, and the agenda-driven nature of some decisions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Employees<|>ORGANIZATION<|>City of Coral Gables employees who are recognized during Commission meetings or special ceremonies and have expressed a preference to be recognized in the Commission Chambers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Recognition Ceremony<|>PROJECT<|>A proposed or discussed special ceremony for recognizing City of Coral Gables employees separately from the regular Commission meetings to allow proper focus and interaction.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Survey<|>DOCUMENT_NUMBER<|>A survey conducted among employees regarding their preferences for recognition ceremonies, which Commissioner Castro believes was not worded to clearly convey the special nature of the recognition.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commission Meetings<|>Recognition Ceremony<|>Recognition ceremonies are proposed to be held separately from Commission meetings to reduce the length of presentations and protocols during meetings and better focus on residents' items.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commission<|>Commission Meetings<|>The Commission conducts the Commission meetings where presentations, protocols, and recognitions take place.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Castro<|>Recognition Ceremony<|>Commissioner Castro supports the recognition ceremony and pledges to attend every time, emphasizing its importance.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Commission Meetings<|>Commissioner Menendez raises concerns about the length of presentations and protocols during Commission meetings and seeks solutions.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Recognition Ceremony<|>Commissioner Fernandez supports a hybrid approach that includes a special recognition ceremony while still allowing presentations during Commission meetings.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>Employees<|>Mayor Lago references the employees' preference to be recognized in the Commission Chambers and discusses past meeting practices.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Employees<|>Recognition Ceremony<|>Employees are the focus of the recognition ceremony and have expressed preferences regarding the location of recognition.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Survey<|>Employees<|>The survey was conducted among employees to gather their preferences about recognition ceremonies, though its wording was criticized.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
