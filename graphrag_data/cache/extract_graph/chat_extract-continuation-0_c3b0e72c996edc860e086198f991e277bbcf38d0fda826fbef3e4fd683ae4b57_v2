And if there was a violation,  then we would take action to enforce the covenant is what we would do.  That would be our recourse.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: And I agree,  there are other schools,  I know the charter school on Segovia,  when they were approved,  all the schools have their limitations.\n\nMs. Russo:   Gulliver,  St. Thomas also have student…\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   But I know people are watching,  they want to know, well, is it binding? So, that' s good to know.  In terms of the footprint of the school,  Madam City Attorney,  when 2002 there were agreements,  things that were approved,  was the footprint of the school limited in any documentation?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  So, there is a site plan that was approved.   This is one of the buildings that is part of that site plan that it was --  the existing structure is smaller than what they are proposing. They' re proposing to demolish the existing building within the site plan and construct a larger building.   Is that accurate?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   How about the building itself?\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMs. Russo:   The building itself is the same size.   The extra square footage comes from the now enclosed concrete walkway for security purposes.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   I'm talking about the campus.\n\nMs. Russo:   Those of you with small children know that you can' t -- you don' t want access to children.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   So,  this -my understanding is that this request does not change the boundaries of the site plan.\n\nMs. Russo:   That is correct.   The boundaries remain the same.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   My follow-up question,  and I totally understand having a property that people can --  visitors can stay, you know, close to the school,  the church.  When they acquired that property --  and I totally support and understand having it for guests --  did that change the footprint of the campus,  or is that something they should have notified the City that we' ve added a property?\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:  No, they have a right to purchase and own property.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.\n\nCity Attorney SuÆrez:   It has --  it is not connected to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Okay.   Right, and no, I just want to check off the boxes.\n\nMs. Russo:   Yeah,  to connect it, let' s just say,  we' re not going to do it, but let' s just say,  it would have to come before DRC, it would have to go before the Planning and Zoning Board, and it would be a change in land use and a change in zoning and a major amendment to the site plan.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   Like I said,  the fact that you' re not having classes or events,  it's --  I understand the need for it.  I just don' t want to cross that line at any point because it' s not good for the school,  the church,  or the City in general,  or obviously,  the residents.   I totally support the direction my colleagues are headed with between first and second reading.   I personally suggest don' t bring this back on second reading unless there' s a true agreement because we don' t want to repeat today.   And with regards to signage,  the residential permit,  I asked the City Manager,  that area does qualify for it, but again,  things have to be enforced and we all know because we have traffic circles,  we have speed bumps,  sometimes physical additions are required because people just regardless of what the sign says,  do whatever they want.   So, I'm in support of the direction my colleagues are headed with this first to second reading.\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:   Okay,  so we can close this out between first and second,  if I'm getting the vibe of what this Commission is headed. So,  we' re going to move forward on first reading.   To move forward,  obviously,  we' re going to take a vote now.   What we' re requesting between first and second is -- okay, would you like to say something?\n\nMs. Russo:   No, no.\n\nMayor Lago:   No, I just want to make sure.\n\nMs. Russo:   I'm just acknowledging that we' re going to be meeting with the City Attorney and City Manager.\n\nMayor Lago:   What I would like is for there to be a meeting between the applicant and the City, the City Attorney,  City Manager,  and yourself,  if any other residents would like to join, to make sure that we address the issues with the swales.   What are we talking about?   A swale package of one form or another,  or what the Vice Mayor said in regards to the opportunity to address resident parking,  which has to be enforced.   Again,  that puts another burden of proof on you, because I'll tell you why.   Because you have to call --  if someone parks there,  you have to call and get it enforced.   When you have the swale package in place, you' re not calling anybody because no one, unless they' re, you know,  destructive individuals and they park\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a city commissioner involved in the discussion regarding school property agreements, site plans, and enforcement of covenants related to student enrollment and campus footprint)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUÁREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Suárez, the city attorney providing legal opinions on binding agreements, enforcement of covenants, and site plan regulations related to school property)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSO<|>PERSON<|>Ms. Russo, a city official or staff member providing information about school buildings, site plans, and campus boundaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the mayor presiding over the city commission meeting and facilitating the discussion and voting process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where discussions about school property agreements, site plans, enforcement, and related issues took place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITE PLAN<|>PROJECT<|>The approved site plan for the school property, including existing buildings and proposed demolition and construction, with boundaries that have not changed despite property acquisitions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHOOL PROPERTY AGREEMENTS<|>PROJECT<|>Legal binding agreements related to student enrollment limitations, property footprint, and covenants that govern the use and development of school properties including charter schools and private schools)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWALE PACKAGE<|>PROJECT<|>A proposed or discussed package of measures related to swales intended to address resident parking enforcement and other related issues around the school property)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESIDENT PARKING ENFORCEMENT<|>PROJECT<|>Efforts and measures to enforce parking restrictions for residents near the school property, including the burden of proof on residents to report violations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>SUÁREZ<|>Commissioner Menendez consults City Attorney Suárez for legal opinions on binding agreements and site plan enforcement<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>RUSSO<|>Commissioner Menendez asks Ms. Russo about details of the school building and campus footprint<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENENDEZ<|>SITE PLAN<|>Commissioner Menendez inquires about limitations and changes to the school site plan and property footprint<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUÁREZ<|>SITE PLAN<|>City Attorney Suárez explains the legal status and boundaries of the approved site plan and property acquisitions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSO<|>SITE PLAN<|>Ms. Russo provides information about the building size and site plan boundaries<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>Mayor Lago presides over the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>SWALE PACKAGE<|>Mayor Lago requests meetings to address issues related to the swale package and resident parking enforcement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SWALE PACKAGE<|>RESIDENT PARKING ENFORCEMENT<|>The swale package is discussed as a measure to help enforce resident parking restrictions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MENENDEZ<|>Commissioner Menendez participates actively in the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>SUÁREZ<|>City Attorney Suárez provides legal counsel during the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>RUSSO<|>Ms. Russo provides information and responses during the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
