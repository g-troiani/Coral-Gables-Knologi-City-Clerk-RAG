I know that it is a major fire issue.  I've driven through parts of North Gables where you have homes that have shutters on every single opening that' s visible from the street.  I also think we are trying to keep a look for our city, we go through this lengthy approval process to make sure that homes look good and look appropriate for Code Enforcement,  and this is one thing. I understand during hurricane season sometimes you have that first storm that comes up, you put up your shutters,  and it is cumbersome and difficult to remove them.  We have folks who don' t necessarily have the ability to do it themselves and have to rely on family members.  So,  what I wanted to do was give a buffer so that you have through the end of hurricane season and possibly a storm that lingers after hurricane season and give a two-week cushion after that last storm or after the end of hurricane season for folks to take them down.  I think after hurricane seasons complete those shutters should be taken down for the reasons that have been addressed.\n\nMayor Lago:  Any public comment,  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I have a question.  I don' t see a warning procedure in here. Most things that we deal with, and this is not a life - we usually have a warning procedure.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, this isn' t sending a specific enforcement mechanism in this ordinance. It would revert to our standard,  which is we can always issue a warning.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Some of these -  I can understand why there' s not a warning on some of the items here listed, but I would like a warning.  Homeowners Association always tells somebody you have 30-35 days to take them down otherwise XYZ penalty will be imposed.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'm willing to bet that when you think about it, the person who probably has their shutters up for a long time is an elderly person.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago:  Who paid somebody to put their shutters up or a daughter or son to go and put their shutters up,  they don' t live in Miami- Dade County or they do, but they are busy with their own\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nlives and they haven' t been able to get to it, because its an endeavor and you are talking about somebody you hit them with another $ 500 fine right off the bat, its tough, you know, and then we get the call and its like, you know how it works, its like we send it to you and show leniency,  this person is 90 years old, what do we do.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Miami Lakes had the same sort of thing, and I was the shutter- installer,  so I had to make time.\n\nMayor Lago:  Or the person is disabled,  good example.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Its not an easy process.  I've done it and it's not fun.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No, no, its not fun, that' s why I think at least 30 days.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Correct.  I thought there was a provision that we would fall back on, that was my understanding.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, a Code Enforcement Officer always has the ability to issue a warning before enforcement. If the Commission wants to mandate in this particular regulation that a warning must be issued first, we can certainly incorporate that into it.\n\nMayor Lago:  If the sponsor would allow me. I would want to make sure that that' s memorialized because at the end of the day,  I'm pretty sure we' re dealing with elderly people,  older people, disabled people who, I don' t think anybody wants to live in their house completely shuddered like that, you don' t see any sunlight.  I don' t think it' s a very pleasant situation.  So, I think those people probably need to be pushed or helped in one way or another to get those shutters off.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I'd be happy to amend it to add a 30-day warning as the first course of action from the city.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Mr. Clerk, do we have any public comment?\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  No, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  I'll entertain a motion.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Move.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Second.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  Yes Commissioner Castro:  Yes\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Yes Commissioner Menendez:  Yes Mayor Lago:  Yes Vote: 5-0)\n\nAssistant City Attorney\n\nCeballos:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Thank you.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a city commissioner concerned about fire safety and the regulation of shutters on homes, advocating for a buffer period after hurricane season for shutter removal and proposing a 30-day warning before enforcement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the mayor presiding over the city commission meeting, emphasizing leniency and consideration for elderly and disabled residents regarding shutter removal enforcement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, the vice mayor participating in the discussion, advocating for a warning procedure before enforcement and sharing personal experience with shutter installation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUAREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Suarez, providing legal advice on enforcement procedures and the possibility of incorporating mandatory warnings into the ordinance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Urquia, responsible for managing public comments during the city commission meeting, reporting no public comments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEBALLOS<|>PERSON<|>Assistant City Attorney Ceballos, present at the meeting and acknowledged by the mayor and commissioners)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting, the official meeting where city commissioners and officials discuss and vote on local government matters including shutter regulations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHUTTER REGULATION ORDINANCE<|>ORDINANCE<|>An ordinance under discussion regulating the use and removal of shutters on homes, particularly after hurricane season, including provisions for a warning period before enforcement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHUTTER REMOVAL WARNING PROCEDURE<|>RESOLUTION<|>A proposed resolution or amendment to the ordinance to mandate a 30-day warning period before enforcement actions are taken against homeowners who fail to remove shutters after hurricane season)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>SHUTTER REGULATION ORDINANCE<|>Commissioner Fernandez is the sponsor and main advocate for the ordinance regulating shutter use and removal<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>SHUTTER REGULATION ORDINANCE<|>Mayor Lago presides over the meeting discussing the ordinance and emphasizes leniency for elderly and disabled residents affected by the ordinance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDERSON<|>SHUTTER REMOVAL WARNING PROCEDURE<|>Vice Mayor Anderson advocates for including a warning procedure in the ordinance, suggesting a 30-day warning before enforcement<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>SHUTTER REMOVAL WARNING PROCEDURE<|>Commissioner Fernandez agrees to amend the ordinance to include a 30-day warning as the first enforcement step<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUAREZ<|>SHUTTER REGULATION ORDINANCE<|>City Attorney Suarez provides legal guidance on enforcement mechanisms related to the ordinance and the possibility of mandatory warnings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>URQUIA<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>City Clerk Urquia manages public comments during the City Commission Meeting where the ordinance is discussed<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CEBALLOS<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>Assistant City Attorney Ceballos is present and acknowledged during the City Commission Meeting<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FERNANDEZ<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>Commissioner Fernandez participates actively in the City Commission Meeting discussing the ordinance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAGO<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>Mayor Lago presides over the City Commission Meeting where the ordinance and related issues are discussed<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDERSON<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>Vice Mayor Anderson participates in the City Commission Meeting discussing the ordinance and warning procedures<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
