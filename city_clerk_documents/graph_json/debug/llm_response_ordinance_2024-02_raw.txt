Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this ordinance document. The user says to look through the entire document. The code should be like E-2 or F-10.

First, I'll start skimming through the text. The document is about amendments to various city code sections. The main body lists sections being amended, but those are section numbers, not agenda items. 

Lookinging at the end of the document, after the sections, there's a part where it mentions the voting and adoption. Let me check the pages towards the end. 

Looking at Page 2 of 3, near the bottom: "Unanimous: 5-0 Vote) AgendaItem: E-2) APPROVED..." 

Ah there it is! The line says "Agend item: E-2". That's the format they're asking for. I need to make sure there's no other code elsewhere. 

I'll quickly scan again. The rest of the document has section numbers like 1-2, 2-464, etc., but those are code sections, not agenda items. The only AgendaItem mentioned is E-2. 

So the answer should be AGENDA_ITEM: E-2.

AGENDA_ITEM: E-2
