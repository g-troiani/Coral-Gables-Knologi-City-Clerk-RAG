In my perfect world, Miracle Mile should glow during the winter, during the holidays,  glow, and people like, hey, let' s drive to Coral Gables Miracle Mile so we can just see how beautifully lit and create sort of a winter wonderland concept. I think that' s what -  without that we can put all the decorations possible on trees and it will look like Charlie Brown' s Christmas Tree which sort of you know,  tips over.  I would like to create, what is it, the wow. I want people to feel wow and the lighting is the key,  I think,  and since the Mayor did mention that we have Commissioner Castro,  Commissioner Fernandez weren' t here when the whole BID, not now, but could you or somebody maybe in February give a history of the responsibilities for Miracle Mile and how we now transition to the city doing it. So,  I think I want to fill in any gaps,  because now, obviously,  we' re tasked with it and we all want to put our best foot forward,  but if you could do just a brief how we got here, that would be helpful.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Vice Mayor Anderson:  So, I'm going to dovetail. As I handed out to you, this was a communication with residents,  and it was on Next-door, so I want to make sureâ€¦\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Very popular topic on Next-door.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I make sure I put my communications back to the residents.  What they would like, the main complaint there was lack of color.  This was an invitation that I sent to them to participate and there is a willingness of residents to participate,  but our history on trying to do something with Miracle Mile goes back when the BID was here,  Slesnick came in and visited every single one of us who was in office at the time,  basically imploring us to dress up Miracle Mile. I brought in pictures from Winter Park' s main drag,  showing what they had done.  People want some color, people want some flash to show there, but we don' t want it too bright either.  So, maybe I don' t know if we need to dim down some of the other lights so that the decorations are the showcase.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  No sunglasses needed.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  No sunglasses needed.  So,  some of those vertical poles when we talked about Calvin rating, I don' t know if we can either through a film or something to kind of tone them down a little bit so its not hard to look at, so that the lights on the trees and the decorations on the trees are the center of focus,  as opposed to the glare that you get from some of the lights on the Mile in one corner and some of the crosswalk areas.  So, I just wanted to share this communication with you all, with the residents,  they are interested in participating.  You might get a reach out from them saying,  here' s our ideas and we all collaborate and get a better pizza, so-to-speak.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I also think it' s important to keep in mind that while we want something at night, we do need to get a good bang for our dollar too, and make sure that they are really impactful in the daytime.  Just keep that in mind as well,  because we do have a big population in the daytime,  and we want to make sure that they enjoy it also.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Thank you.\n\nMayor Lago:  Thank you.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Thank you.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Miracle Mile<|>PROJECT<|>Miracle Mile, a prominent commercial district in Coral Gables, discussed as a location intended to be decorated and lit during the winter holidays to create a winter wonderland effect and attract visitors to see its beautiful lighting.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, where discussions about Miracle Mile lighting and decorations took place, involving various city officials and residents.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, a city official who shared communications with residents about Miracle Mile lighting, emphasizing resident participation and concerns about lighting color and brightness.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Castro<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Castro, a city commissioner mentioned as not present during earlier BID discussions related to Miracle Mile responsibilities.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a city commissioner who participated in the January 9, 2024 meeting, acknowledged the popularity of Miracle Mile lighting on Next-door and thanked others during the discussion.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a city commissioner who contributed to the discussion by humorously noting \"No sunglasses needed\" regarding lighting brightness.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>Mayor Lago<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, the mayor who participated in the meeting and thanked others during the Miracle Mile lighting discussion.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>Economic Development Director Perez<|>PERSON<|>Economic Development Director Perez, a city official who emphasized the importance of cost-effectiveness and impact of Miracle Mile lighting both at night and during the daytime.)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business Improvement District (BID), the former organization responsible for Miracle Mile decorations and lighting, referenced as having been involved in past efforts to dress up Miracle Mile.)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>Miracle Mile<|>BID<|>Miracle Mile's past lighting and decoration efforts were managed by the BID, as referenced by Vice Mayor Anderson discussing the history of responsibilities before transitioning to the city.<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Vice Mayor Anderson spoke and shared communications with residents during the January 9, 2024 City Commission Meeting.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Commissioner Fernandez<|>Commissioner Fernandez participated in the January 9, 2024 City Commission Meeting discussing Miracle Mile lighting.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Commissioner Menendez<|>Commissioner Menendez contributed comments during the January 9, 2024 City Commission Meeting.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Mayor Lago<|>Mayor Lago participated and thanked others during the January 9, 2024 City Commission Meeting.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>City Commission Meeting January 9, 2024<|>Economic Development Director Perez<|>Economic Development Director Perez spoke about cost-effectiveness and impact of lighting during the January 9, 2024 City Commission Meeting.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>BID<|>Vice Mayor Anderson referenced the BID's past involvement in Miracle Mile lighting and decorations during the meeting.<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>Vice Mayor Anderson<|>Miracle Mile<|>Vice Mayor Anderson communicated resident feedback and ideas about Miracle Mile lighting and decorations.<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>Economic Development Director Perez<|>Miracle Mile<|>Economic Development Director Perez discussed the importance of impactful lighting for Miracle Mile both at night and during the day.<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
