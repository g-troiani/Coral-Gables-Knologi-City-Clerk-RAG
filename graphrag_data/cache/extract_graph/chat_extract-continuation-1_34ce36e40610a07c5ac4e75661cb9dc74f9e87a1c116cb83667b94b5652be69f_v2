( Sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez)\n\nMayor Lago:  Moving onto E-7.\n\nCity Attorney Suarez: E-7 is an Ordinance of the City Commission providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code, Creating Section 5-314 ' Window and Hurricane Shutters' to regulate the closure of window and hurricane shutters and amending the City Code, Chapter 1-General Provisions,  Section 1-7 entitled ' Penalties'  to provide a penalty for the closure of window and hurricane shutters outside of the hurricane season;  providing for severability clause,\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nrepealer provision,  codification,  and providing for an effective date. This is a public hearing item. Assistant City Attorney Gus Ceballos will present the ordinance.\n\nMayor Lago: May I ask you a quick question Mr. City Attorney,  because I know I've had residents call me before or send an email in regard to code enforcement issues,  their neighbors have their windows closed,  shutters.  How have we addressed this before with Code Enforcement when those individuals have been turned into Code Enforcement.\n\nAssistant City Attorney Ceballos:  Typically,  Code Enforcement will go out and our code doesn' t prohibit the closure of the shutters.  There are other parts of our city code that may apply to abandoned property,  if you have all the windows shuddered.  There are other characteristics to get the meat in order to fall under that definition of an abandoned property and that' s a different enforcement mechanism. This creates a simpler enforcement mechanism specifically for the purpose of shutters.  We know it happens all the time. People put them up and then the next thing you know its February and people still have their shutters up. Frankly, for whatever reason whether its laziness or they just haven' t had the chance or the time, this is an enforcement mechanism that will address that particular item independent of all the other issues with an abandoned property.\n\nMayor Lago:  So, what they do is, they basically have a conversation with the property owner and speak to them about opening up their windows.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  May I say something.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Its also a building code issue,  because you need ventilation,  and you need egress.\n\nMayor Lago:  Of course.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  So, you' ve got two building code issues where you have an unsafe structure at that point.\n\nMayor Lago:  But my question was, how would we address it, because I know that residents have sent us emails over the years saying listen,  my neighbor doesn' t have one window open in their house,  its all shuddered,  how have we addressed that.  I've even had it on the garage,  and they' ve complied through Code Enforcement.  How did we get it done before?\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Ceballos:  So, I personally have never had to deal with that particular issue before. What I can do is I can find out from\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E-7<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-7 discussed at the City Commission meeting on January 9, 2024, concerning a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code regarding window and hurricane shutters.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE TEXT AMENDMENT TO CITY OF CORAL GABLES OFFICIAL ZONING CODE<|>ORDINANCE<|>An ordinance providing for a text amendment to the City of Coral Gables Official Zoning Code, creating Section 5-314 'Window and Hurricane Shutters' to regulate closure of window and hurricane shutters, amending Chapter 1-General Provisions, Section 1-7 'Penalties' to provide penalties for closure outside hurricane season, including severability, repealer, codification, and effective date provisions.
