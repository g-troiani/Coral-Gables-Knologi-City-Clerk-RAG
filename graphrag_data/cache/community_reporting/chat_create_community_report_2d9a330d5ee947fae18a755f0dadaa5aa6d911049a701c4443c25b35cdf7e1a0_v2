Since late last year, he has worked closely with city staff on ordinances, particularly those related to signage and window/hurricane shutter regulations, advocating for balanced approaches that consider both safety and aesthetics. Notably, he sponsored multiple ordinances and resolutions, including amendments to sign regulations and hurricane shutter rules, proposing a 30-day warning period before enforcement actions to ensure fairness and compliance.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez consistently emphasizes the importance of community input and collaboration.
