Passed unanimously with a 5-0 vote by Commissioners Castro, Fernandez, Menendez, Anderson, and Lago, and attested by City Attorney Cristina M. Suarez, the ordinance reflects a comprehensive update aimed at modernizing legal notice publication, clarifying zoning regulations, and addressing community concerns.\n\nA significant aspect of the ordinance is the amendment to the City of Coral Gables Zoning Code allowing the publication of legal notices on a publicly accessible website. This change aligns with Florida Statutes, promotes cost savings, and modernizes the City’s notification procedures. Previously, the ordinance required publication of notices within 30 days in a newspaper of general circulation, with all associated costs borne by the applicant. The updated ordinance maintains the requirement for recording and filing certified copies in the county public records, ensuring transparency and public accessibility.\n\nThe ordinance also includes provisions that integrate its amendments into the Zoning Code, allowing for changes to sections, articles, and other relevant references, including the Table of Contents, to reflect the ordinance’s intentions. These changes become effective immediately upon passage and adoption.\n\nIn addition to procedural updates, the ordinance addresses specific zoning criteria, such as parking reductions. As discussed by Planning Official Garcia, the ordinance defines criteria for parking reductions that consider accessible routes to major transit stops, sidewalks, ramps, and crosswalks. Notably, it specifies that no amendment is required if bus stops are eliminated, providing clarity and flexibility in transit-related zoning requirements.\n\nThe ordinance further touches on signage regulations within the City, particularly focusing on issues of sign pollution and compliance in the Central Business District. This aspect of the ordinance has been a subject of community and Commission discussion, linked to ongoing enforcement efforts aimed at maintaining aesthetic standards and regulatory compliance in commercial areas.\n\nMoreover, the ordinance includes provisions granting applications for abandonment, with certified copies filed in the county public records and associated notice costs borne by the applicant, ensuring procedural consistency and accountability.\n\nOverall, the January 9, 2024 ordinance represents a multifaceted update to Coral Gables’ regulatory framework, enhancing legal notice publication methods, refining zoning code provisions related to parking and signage, and reinforcing procedural requirements for applications and public record filings. The unanimous passage underscores broad Commission support for these measures designed to improve governance, transparency, and community standards within the City of Coral Gables.\",29\n367,CERTIFIED COPY OF ORDINANCE,Certified copy of the adopted ordinance filed in the public records of the county.,1\n672,CRISTINA M.
