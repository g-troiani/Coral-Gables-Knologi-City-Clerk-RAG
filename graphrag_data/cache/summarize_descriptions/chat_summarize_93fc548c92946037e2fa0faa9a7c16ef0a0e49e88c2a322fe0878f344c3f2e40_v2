Notably, FPL has been identified as the entity responsible for the removal of silver streetlights throughout the City, a process referenced specifically in Agenda Item 2-1. This removal has raised concerns, leading the Historic Preservation Board to request an immediate cessation of the silver streetlight removals to preserve the City’s historic character.
