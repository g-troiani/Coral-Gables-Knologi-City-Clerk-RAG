precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

So, you' re going from --  you' re really going to a postcard.   And real quick,  as we discussed,  people think signs are obsolete and that everyone uses the internet and the listing services. That is absolutely not true.   I have had multiple clients of mine that actually drive --  yeah,  even if I do a survey,  they' re still going to drive and make sure --  and there are properties that have signs.   And it' s mainly the small businesses that don' t know how to put their property on the internet,  on CoStar,  on LoopNet.   They' re the ones that rely on those signs more than any of them,  than any other business.   So, I think it' s very important.   And I'll tell you that the City of Coral Gables is already known to have the most stringent sign code of any municipality in Miami-Dade County and beyond.   We are in a competitive market right now.   We are fighting to make sure that we maintain as much occupancy of our buildings,  which is in the best interest of everyone,  including our --  and drive our economy and City revenue. And to take away any aspect of marketing a property,  in my mind, will result in the potential of a reduction there.   And then further,  unlike -as Manny had mentioned,  you would think residential is the same as commercial.   It's not true.  It is a completely different world of being a residential broker and a commercial broker.   And unlike\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential rental and sales signage that has worked with the postcard size, commercial real estate signs are materially more important to business and property owners.   And again,  most of these are small businesses. Many tenants and buyers actually,  as mentioned,  drive through the City. And so,  again,  I respectfully disagree that the proposed ordinance' s stated business impact of essentially limiting how many business users of these such real estate signs.  I do think it will hurt our economy,  have that potential to do so.   It is something that doesn' t just affect the real estate community. You have tenants that have space that need to sublease their space. It' s their responsibility to sublease their space. If they don' t sublease their space,  especially in a timely manner,  it can damage that business. So,  there are direct implications to the business impact in this.   So, I know we would, as a Chamber,  would like to have ample time to vet this, six months or whatever the appropriate time is, and then come back and then let' s see what the impact is and let' s have more edification on this before we move forward.   Thank you for your time and for hearing my comments.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, sir.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:   Anyone else in the Commission?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes, I…\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes, Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I just learned about this item really when it was published,  you know, to be able to actually take a look at the language.   Language does matter.   I don' t think there' s been adequate time to weigh the compliance requirements of the DBPR,  the Department of Business Professional Regulation.   I'm looking up some of it right now, versus the impact on the commercial real estate individuals who do this as a profession. But I do know from my experience dealing with commercial leases and entities that have to do the subleasing and so forth,  and my own experience going around and looking for commercial space,  I'm walking and looking for these signs and to have these little postage stamps on there,  especially when you' re talking about,  you know, requirements,  how many square feet, you know, am I even interested in looking at it, type of thing,  is a tremendous impact on the ability not only for practitioners to be able to do the marketing,  but also for the customers themselves.   Like, if I'm looking for new office space,  where am I going to go look?  I'm going to be walking in an area that I want to be in.  I'm very particular because I like to walk to my office.  So, you know, that' s how sensitive some of these issues are. Or you want to be near a different type of business because you don' t want to have too many restaurants next to each other.   You want to go walk that area and see how many restaurants are there.  Is there a clothing store there?  Is the clothing store wanting to be near the restaurant because the traffic that goes to the restaurant is going to be browsing then the clothing and going and buying that.   So,  the walkability of the area and the parking,  et cetera,  is a critical,  critical issue.   So,  I\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nrespectfully ask for this one to be postponed until another meeting later so that we can have additional input.\n\nMayor Lago:   Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:   When I had this item -- discussed it on agenda review, I had a difficult time grasping visually the difference in the two sizes.   I think staff has examples of what one is. No, just if you want to go up there so everybody can see the difference in size.   Because I was trying to size up a TV, you know.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City of Coral Gables, known to have the most stringent sign code of any municipality in Miami-Dade County and beyond, operating in a competitive market to maintain building occupancy and drive economy and City revenue.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, during which discussions about commercial real estate signage and related ordinances took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE SIGNS<|>PROJECT<|>Commercial real estate signs, materially important to business and property owners, especially small businesses, used for marketing and subleasing spaces within the City of Coral Gables.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>ORDINANCE<|>A proposed ordinance discussed at the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, intended to limit the size and number of commercial real estate signs, with potential business impact and economic implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DBPR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Business Professional Regulation (DBPR), referenced in relation to compliance requirements affecting commercial real estate signage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAMBER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chamber, representing business interests, requesting ample time (six months or more) to vet the proposed ordinance and assess its impact before moving forward.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, facilitating discussion and acknowledging speakers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, participating in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, expressing concerns about the proposed ordinance and requesting postponement for further input.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, attending the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, discussing agenda review and seeking visual clarification on sign size differences.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE SIGNS<|>The proposed ordinance directly regulates commercial real estate signs by limiting their size and number, as discussed in the meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>The proposed ordinance was discussed during the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>Vice Mayor Anderson expressed concerns about the proposed ordinance and requested postponement for additional input.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAMBER<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>The Chamber requested ample time to vet the proposed ordinance and assess its business impact before proceeding.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DBPR<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>The proposed ordinance's compliance requirements were compared to those of the DBPR by Vice Mayor Anderson.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>Mayor Lago presided over the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>Commissioner Menendez participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024 and discussed agenda review items.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
