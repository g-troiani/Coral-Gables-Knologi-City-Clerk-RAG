Key entities include various types of notices such as Mailed Notice, Notice of Change, Hand Delivered Notice, and different categories of Comprehensive Plan Amendments. These entities are interconnected through relationships that define the requirements and timing for public notifications related to zoning, ordinance changes, and planning amendments. The community reflects a structured compliance system ensuring transparency and public participation in municipal governance.\",\n  \"rating\": 6.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderately high due to the community's critical role in ensuring legal compliance and public awareness in urban planning and zoning processes, which can significantly affect community development and stakeholder interests.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Notice of Change as a central notification mechanism\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Notice of Change entity plays a pivotal role in the community by serving as the primary form of advertisement used by the City of Coral Gables to announce proposed ordinances, including details such as ordinance title, hearing dates, and geographic location maps. It is directly linked to multiple types of Comprehensive Plan Amendments and zoning changes, indicating its broad application in public notification processes.
