Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this Coral Gables ordinance document. The user wants only the code in the format AGENDA_ITEM: [code]. Let me start by skimming through the entire document text provided.

First, I'll look for any mention of "Agenda Item" or similar terms. Scanning through the sections, near the end of the document, I see a line that says "AgendaItem: E-3)" towards the bottom of the page before the closing sections. Wait, maybe there's a typo here? It says "AgendaItem:" but spelled as "AgendaItem"? Let me check again. 

Looking at the text again, in the section after the vote details, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-3)". The word "Agenda" might be a typo for "Agenda". Since the instruction says to extract exactly what's there, even if there's a typo, but maybe I should confirm. Alternatively, maybe it's correctly spelled as "AgendaItem" without a space. 

Looking again, the exact line is written as "AgendaItem: E-3)". The parentheses might be part of the formatting. The code here is E-3. 

I should check if there are any other instances. Scanning through the entire document again, especially in the sections where agendas are mentioned. In the WHEREAS clauses, there's a mention of the City Commission determining the item didn't need to go to the Planning and Zoning Board prior to second reading, but that doesn't have the code. 

Looking at the very end of the document, the same line appears again in another page: "AgendaItem: E-3)" on page 2 of 34. Since the user said to search the entire document, but the code is mentioned there. 

Even if there's a possible typo in "AgendaItem" (maybe missing a space?), the code is E-3. The user wants only the code, so the answer should be E-3. I don't see any other codes mentioned elsewhere. 

Therefore, the correct code is E-3.
