Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

You could do a smaller rotunda, you could do something where it goes into in between the larger building and the building that I'm talking about that those two nice ladies own, you could do something there,  but again,  this is just dreaming,  but if you could incorporate that building then you could do something.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: That' s a whole different conversation.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s a whole different conversation.\n\nPublic Works Director Diaz: Absolutely.\n\nMayor Lago:  That is a whole different conversation because you could put a cul-de-sac right in front of that building,  so if cars come you could go,  you could even go into Pittman Park and maybe take a corner of it and do something great.  You would take all those parking spaces on both sides and then you would have more flexibility to do something great.  But I wanted to bring this to your attention because,  if you see opportunities like this, which is something that I'm going to be bringing,  not I'm going to be bringing,  its an applicant that' s bringing a project next month that we' ve been working on for four years,  I mentioned to you before.  If we think a little bit outside the box. This one will cost us money,  but if you think outside the box, there' s opportunities to get partnerships with developers,  landowners,  people who have a vested interest in the city to really do some great things. This is something just to think about for the future,  put it away.  I don' t even want to spend the money on conceptual,  park layout, traffic study, because money is so tight right now that it's not even worth doing it, because it' s not feasible,  not feasible.
