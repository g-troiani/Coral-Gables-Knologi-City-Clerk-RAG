These regulations specify responsibilities for property owners, pole owners, and attaching entities, including notification procedures, code enforcement violations, and administrative review criteria for above-ground appurtenances. The framework is supported by city ordinances such as Section 78-281 and Section 101-137, as well as Florida Statute 366.97 and Florida Public Service Commission orders, which collectively ensure that undergrounding projects comply with local and state laws. This regulatory environment creates a structured process for underground utility installation, redundant pole removal, and enforcement of penalties for non-compliance [Data: Entities (176, 149, 179, 180, 181); Relationships (206, 210, 211, 212, 208)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Property owners bear primary responsibility for utility conversion costs and compliance\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Property owners in areas served by new underground utility facilities are mandated to arrange for the conversion of existing overhead service facilities to underground installations.

Property owners must also rearrange and modify electric service facilities to accommodate underground utilities. The obligation is triggered when rehabilitation costs of structures exceed 50 percent of their replacement value, as determined by the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser. This threshold ensures that only significant rehabilitation projects require underground conversion, providing a balance between infrastructure modernization and property owner burden.
