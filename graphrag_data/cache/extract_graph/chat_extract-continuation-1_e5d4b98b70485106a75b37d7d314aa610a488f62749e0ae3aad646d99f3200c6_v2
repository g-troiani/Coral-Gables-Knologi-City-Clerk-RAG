So,  again,  we' re talking about the southeast portion of the site and looking at the proposed building,  it would have classrooms one and two for preschool on the front, the back-ofhouse equipment is located west of the building away from the single- family adjacent house, restored swale on the front of the structure of the proposed preschool building,  a front yard.   The storage is going to be acting as a buffer between the existing home to the east and the actual preschool area,  and in the back is a multi-purpose room and playground.   Here' s a rendering of what that looks like.  Again,  this was approved by the Board of Architects.   It went to DRC back in April of last year.   Board of Architects,  a couple of times, and approval in August.   They had a neighborhood meeting in October. Planning and Zoning Board recommended approval in November,  and here we are for first reading at City Commission.   So, the letters were sent to the property within a thousand feet as required by code,  and that happened three times so far.  It was posted twice,  three times website posting and once for newspaper advertisements. So,  staff has determined that it' s consistent with the comp plan and it complies with all the findings of fact, which is part of your packet and the staff report today.   So,  there' s two conditions of approval. The first one is the non-operable fixed windows on the façade facing the adjacent abutting neighbor to the east.   The swale improvements on the front, and as she indicated,  the Planning and Zoning Board wanted to expand that and have it on Cordova as well between Coral Way and Andalusia to prevent parking and other issues that the school,  I guess,  has been dealing with for quite some time.  And all the conditions that are listed in Ordinance Number 3576 would still remain in effect. That' s it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you very much.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Thank you.\n\nMs. Russo:  And if you want to see, I have a little PowerPoint that just shows you a little bit, if we can get it.\n\nMayor Lago:   Perfect,  thank you.\n\nCity Planner Garcia:   Could we get the applicant PowerPoint,  please?  Press the big button.\n\nMs. Russo:  Next slide.   Alright,  this is the existing building,  so this is the building that' s being replaced,  the one again on the southeast corner of the campus.   This is the new proposed building. This is the area behind the school,  behind that particular building.   And this is existing.   And you can see there is a -- this particular house had an old detached garage that actually sat on the property\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nline.  So, one of the requirements of the original site plan is if this building ever came down, that garage that' s on the property line would have to be removed and needless to say, all setbacks would have to be observed.   This is what the back will look at.  It will now be set back from the neighbor to the east. And again,  the building that you see without the arches is the one that faces the neighbor and that has the blank wall.   The building with the arches is the one that will have the fixed inoperable windows near the front. This is what the space will look like. This is the multipurpose space.   I'm sorry, the other were the classrooms.   This is the multipurpose space that will also be able to work so that activities,  depending on weather,  as you can see,  it opens up to the backyard.   And that' s it.   I just wanted you to get a little glimpse of what we' re doing.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Mr. Mayor, we have several members of the public requesting to speak on this item.  The first is Norma Perez.\n\nMs. Russo:   She' s decided not to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:   Okay.\n\nMs. Russo:   They just signed in in case they wanted to speak.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Edward Diaz.  Mary Conroy.\n\nCOMMENTS MADE OFF THE RECORD)\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes.\n\nMary Conroy:   Hi, I'm Mary Beth Conroy.   I'm the rector of St. Philip' s.   I've been here for 14 years.   And when I moved here,  I thought I had a great vocabulary,  but I did not know the word swale.   And so,  I've learned something about it.  And thanks to my friendly parishioners,  they taught me that I was to maintain my swale and that it did not belong to me.   And so,  for all the many years I've lived here,  I have replanted my swale,  like I'm sure many of you have.   I've endured neighbors doing construction projects joyfully,  and I'm happy to be in a community that works together so that we can live together in harmony. I will say that St.  Philip' s is in a neighborhood that' s in high demand for parking and we struggle with the same issues that our neighbors do and those who want to attend and use the glorious park that has been provided by the City.   It has only increased and become more challenging. And as Ms. Russo pointed out,  we continue to ask people to rideshare when we have big events,  whether it's a large funeral,  whether it' s a big event for the school.\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOARD OF ARCHITECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Board of Architects, which approved the proposed preschool building design and reviewed it multiple times, including approval in August.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Development Review Committee (DRC), which reviewed the proposed preschool building back in April of the previous year.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Planning and Zoning Board, which recommended approval of the proposed preschool building in November and requested expansion of swale improvements on Cordova between Coral Way and Andalusia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDINANCE 3576<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance Number 3576, which contains conditions of approval that remain in effect for the proposed preschool building project.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPOSED PRESCHOOL BUILDING<|>PROJECT<|>The proposed preschool building project located on the southeast portion of the site, featuring classrooms one and two for preschool at the front, back-of-house equipment west of the building, a restored swale on the front, a front yard, storage acting as a buffer between the existing home to the east and the preschool area, a multi-purpose room and playground at the back, and fixed inoperable windows on the façade facing the adjacent neighbor to the east.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, during which the proposed preschool building project was discussed for first reading.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the City Commission meeting and participating in the discussion of the proposed preschool building project.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, participating in the City Commission meeting discussion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS.
