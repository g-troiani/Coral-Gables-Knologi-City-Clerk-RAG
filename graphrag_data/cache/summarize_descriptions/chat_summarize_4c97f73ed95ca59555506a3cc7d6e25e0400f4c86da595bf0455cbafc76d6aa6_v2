These certificates are required for certain alterations or relocations of significant historic improvements and involve a formal procedure that includes public notice and posting at least ten days prior to public hearings. Additionally, the Historic Preservation Board is authorized to grant Special Certificates of Appropriateness for moving significant improvements when preservation at the original site is not feasible, provided that the new location is compatible with the property's historic and architectural significance.
