Generate a comprehensive community report for city clerk documents.

When analyzing the community, pay special attention to:

1. **Agenda Items**: Identify and highlight agenda items (format: [A-Z]-\d+) and their relationships
2. **Document Numbers**: Track document numbers (format: \d{4}-\d+) and their connections
3. **Meeting Context**: Preserve meeting dates and agenda item sequences
4. **Cross-References**: Maintain relationships between agenda items, ordinances, and resolutions

Structure the report to include:
- Key agenda items and their outcomes
- Important document numbers and their purposes
- Voting patterns and decision-making processes
- Relationships between different document types

Ensure that agenda item codes like "E-1" are prominently featured and their context is preserved.
