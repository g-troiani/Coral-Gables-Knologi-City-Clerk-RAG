Since 2001, the school has maintained a stable enrollment of approximately 180 students and operates for 172 days each year. Over the past 22 years, the school has consistently worked to manage parking and neighborhood concerns, particularly those arising during student pickup and drop-off times. Despite lacking dedicated parking facilities, the school actively discourages parking violations by parents through measures such as publishing monthly newsletters with parking reminders and enforcing staff-imposed parking conditions.\n\nThe school’s property and operations have been the subject of ongoing discussions at City Commission meetings, including the session on January 9, 2024, where topics such as property use, master site planning, restrictive covenants, and potential expansion were addressed. The school is currently subject to enrollment limitations and a restrictive covenant recorded in Miami-Dade County public records, which governs aspects of its property use and development. Notably, the school is expanding its physical footprint by acquiring additional homes across from 1044 Coral Way, increasing its square footage.\n\nNeighborhood concerns have centered on the school’s impact on local traffic and parking, especially regarding the use and maintenance of swales—landscape features designed to manage stormwater runoff. The school has requested to retain staff-imposed conditions aimed at preventing parking violations while seeking to remove a condition that requires the adjacent church to landscape and maintain the swales extending from Coral Way to Andalusia. Recent swale improvements in the area are intended to address some of these parking and environmental issues.\n\nOverall, the school remains an active participant in community and city planning discussions, balancing its growth and operational needs with neighborhood concerns about parking, property use, and environmental maintenance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749563701, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 363, "prompt_tokens": 422, "total_tokens": 785, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
