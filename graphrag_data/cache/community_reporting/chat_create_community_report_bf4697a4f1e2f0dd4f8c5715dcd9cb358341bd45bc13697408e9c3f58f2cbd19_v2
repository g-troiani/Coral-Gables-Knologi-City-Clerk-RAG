Key entities include the Conversion of Overhead to Underground Facilities project, Rehabilitation of Structures, Property Owners, Utility Companies, and Electric Service Facilities. The relationships highlight the conditions under which rehabilitation projects trigger mandatory underground conversion, the responsibilities of property owners in arranging and financing modifications, and the involvement of utility companies in cost-sharing.

This requirement is codified in the Rehabilitation Conversion entity and linked directly to the Rehabilitation of Structures entity, emphasizing the regulatory threshold that triggers undergrounding obligations.

This places a financial and logistical burden on property owners during rehabilitation or conversion projects, highlighting their critical role in the implementation of undergrounding initiatives.
