[{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document from the City of Coral Gables, identify all entities and their relationships with high precision, following strict context rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nEntity types: AGENDA_ITEM, ORDINANCE, PERSON, ORGANIZATION\nText: \"Agenda Item E-1, an ordinance to amend zoning, was passed. This is Ordinance 2024-01.\"\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>E-1<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda item E-1, which is the same as Ordinance 2024-01 and amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024-01<|>ORDINANCE<|>Ordinance 2024-01, also known as agenda item E-1, which amends zoning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same as<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Real Data-\nEntity types: agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project\nText: :  I agree with that one.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I think I'm hypo-glycemic right now.\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we do this. Why don' t we, at the next Commission meeting,  put together something that deals with the morning and an afternoon session,  and we' ll see how that goes with the approval of the Commission through the Manager and we find a solution for that.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  So,  I guess what you' re suggesting is, at 9 a.m. we start with presentation and protocol.\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  9:30 we do time certain public comment.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nMayor Lago:  Why don' t we go earlier. Why don' t we do 8:30? Why not?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Because there are members of staff are coming not from here, there are members of staff who live in Kendall,  who live in Homestead.  You' re affecting…\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on. Hold on. Mr. Manager,  when are employees supposed to be here at work?\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  At 8 o' clock.\n\nMayor Lago:  That' s their job.  So,  if they are coming from Kendall or from anywhere,  they are coming,  at the end of the day, they have got to be here by 8.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I will withdraw my idea. Look, simple.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  My stomach objects.\n\nCommissioner Menendez: I know.  Sorry.  Trial run 9 a.m.  obviously we do the Pledge of Allegiance,  maybe we' re done by 9:30, 9:40, we go to Public Comments,  Time Certain 12:30, and if we' re having a good day, we have lunch right after maybe 15 minutes and we come back to wrap up. At least we have structure and I think if we' re all supportive of that structure,  it will help us make it happen.  So that' s just me. If it doesn' t work, we' ll come up with another.\n\nMayor Lago:  Is that a motion? Want to second that?\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Wait. What time is the…\n\nMayor Lago:  Hold on a second.  Hold on. Hold on.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, because I have a question.\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez: I just have a question about,  what time is the second presentation protocol?\n\nMayor Lago:  12:30.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And then lunch right after that.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  Right after.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Okay.  I'll second.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nCity Attorney Suarez:  So, question.  Is this direction to start this next meeting or is this…?\n\nMayor Lago:  Yes. Yes.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  All in favor.\n\nAll: Aye.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  Anyone opposed?\n\nMayor Lago:  By the way, employees will still be here at 8 o' clock though,  so we could start at 8. Moving on.
