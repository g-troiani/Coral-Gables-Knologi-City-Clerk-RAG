These covenants establish specific conditions that must be met before any demolition can occur, including the requirement of a public hearing and the approval of the Board of Architects. This ensures that any changes to such properties are carefully reviewed and regulated to maintain their integrity and community value. The Declaration of Restrictive Covenants has been referenced in multiple contexts, notably by Ms. Russo in discussions related to school property management, as well as during the City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024. In both instances, the covenants serve as a critical regulatory framework to oversee and control modifications to buildings on these institutional properties, emphasizing transparency and architectural oversight.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840849, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 390, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
