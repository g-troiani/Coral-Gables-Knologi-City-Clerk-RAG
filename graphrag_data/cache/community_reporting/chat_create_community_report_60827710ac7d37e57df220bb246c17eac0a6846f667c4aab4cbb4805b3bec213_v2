The regulation mandates that a warning must be issued as a first step before any enforcement action to remove the shutters. The entities involved include the Regulation itself, the Warning as a procedural requirement, and the Shutters as the subject of the regulation. The relationships clearly define a sequential process where the regulation incorporates the warning, which in turn is intended to encourage or compel the removal of shutters to improve living conditions.\",\n  \"rating\": 4.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is moderate due to the regulation's potential to improve living conditions but limited scope and enforcement complexity.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Regulation targets shutters that block sunlight and degrade living conditions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The regulation is specifically designed to address the problem of shutters on houses that obstruct sunlight and create unpleasant living environments. This indicates a focus on improving residential quality of life by mitigating physical barriers to natural light. The regulation’s intent reflects concerns about health, well-being, and urban living standards, highlighting the social importance of the issue.

This step is intended to provide notice and an opportunity for voluntary compliance, potentially reducing conflict and legal challenges. The warning acts as a formal communication tool embedded within the regulation, emphasizing due process and fairness in enforcement.
