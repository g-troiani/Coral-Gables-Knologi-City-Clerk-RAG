The BID was also responsible for managing the decorations along Miracle Mile, overseeing these efforts until it was removed from this role prior to the 2023 holiday season. Additionally, the BID’s regulations concerning commercial wraps were influential enough to be incorporated into a broader citywide wrap ordinance, indicating its impact on local policy beyond its immediate geographic scope.
