Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

In some cases,  time certain items that weren' t called up on time certain times, because we weren' t able to get to them on time, and we' ve had at least one instance where a member of the Commission was interrupted because another person had to leave the room and we wanted to make sure that they spoke.  We wouldn' t have gotten to that point had we had a specific ceremony for our employees and for the presentation and protocol and that' s the reason that I'm moving forward with this today.\n\nMayor Lago: But I think you also have to also come to terms and it' s the same situation we' ve had in the past with other decisions this Commission has made.  Let' s test the waters with the employees,  okay.  The employees still vote one way,  we' re going to vote against the employees. For example,  the same thing we were talking about the possibility of doing November elections on -  let' s do November elections,  let' s get the pulse of the community and let' s vote on it. Now we don' t want to vote on it. To me, I just think that it's - you may want that, and I understand that, but at the end of the day, the employees who are the ones being recognized are the ones saying we prefer to be in the Commission Chambers.  Honor our request.  If it was the other way around,  205 people were against it, I'd say listen,  let' s move forward with what the employee wants.  I don' t have an issue with it. It's not the first time that we changed gears on issues,  but I just think, with all due respect,  I think it's more agenda- driven than it is actually driven to benefit the employees.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  I commend you for bringing this back. Thank you very much. I thought this was a lost item. I sincerely think that the way that the survey was worded was not the best outcome, because I don' t think the words,  the questions were to really make the employees understand that this was something special for them and as far as me, I could pledge to be there every single time in any award ceremony, so that makes it any more special. I don' t know if the rest of the\n\nCommission is going to be there. I'm pretty sure most of us will be there and it will be even more special.  So, with all my heart I support this.\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  My question is for the administration for the Clerk' s office,  because I think this occurred,  this issue came up because right after the elections we were having an hourand-a-half,  two-hour presentations in protocol section and it was meeting after meeting after meeting,  and we were here 9, 10, 11 hours at the end of the day, and how can -  I'm looking for solutions.  How can we better manage that situation.  Are we the only city that has protocols before the Commission meetings?  Do some have it at noon? I'm looking for something other than one or the other. Is there a hybrid? - because an hour-and- a-half, two hours which everybody is deserving, the people that are recognized,  obviously today was a perfect example,  but why are we having an hour-and-a-half to two-hour protocols when there are folks with items that we need to get to.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  And to answer your question,  Commissioner,  this would still allow for certain items to come before the Commission on the date. This would not preclude us from having presentations and protocols during this meeting.  It would move so that items that are known to be at a certain time and our recognition of our employees to have a special ceremony to recognize them.  So, it is a hybrid which we worked out from the conversations that came about during our initial Commission meeting.  Originally,  the resolution that I had presented was everything would be moved to this ceremony.  This is more of a hybrid based on the input that was gathered during the Commission meeting.\n\nMayor Lago:  Commissioner Menendez,  I want to give you another opportunity.  Excuse me.\n\nCommissioner Castro:  You' re a little funny sometimes but continue.  Another opportunity.  Go. I'm listening.\n\nMayor Lago:  Another opportunity to kind of see it another way.  When Mayor Valdes- Fauli was here,  we used to start the Commission meeting earlier and it was seamless,  and it wasn' t an issue. We had it downstairs.  I think people enjoyed it. It wasn' t an issue. We started 30-45 minutes early. We got here probably at 9:15 and we moved forward pretty quickly.  For some reason I thought that maybe being outside pushed the protocol documents faster,  maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like it was kind of a much faster process.  I said,  let' s get here earlier and let' s get it done.  I'm more than willing to meet here at 8 o' clock in the morning,  at 8:30, get it done,  and we meet the goals of the employees who they stated very clearly by the poll that we took that they would rather have it here and we meet the goal of getting here as quickly as possible and the residents can get here at 9 o' clock, 9:15, to have their items heard in a timely manner without any delays from the protocol section of the meeting.  Does that opportunity work for you?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s definitely one option.  I know we discussed that when this first came up.
