The package is designed to prevent parking on swales, thereby reducing enforcement calls and neighborhood disturbances associated with improper parking. It incorporates the use of native plants, coquina, and gravel to manage the swale areas effectively, balancing environmental considerations such as water use with the need to maintain parking availability.
