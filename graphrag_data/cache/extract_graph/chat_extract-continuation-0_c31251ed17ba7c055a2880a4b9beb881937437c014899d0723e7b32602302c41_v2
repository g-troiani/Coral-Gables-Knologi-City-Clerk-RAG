And so, we just had a nice chat out there.   I appreciate the goodwill and the intent, Commissioner Fernandez,  of you trying to make the City Beautiful more beautiful.   But there are some things,  had I not been in this business for so long, that may seem intuitive,  but they' re not, as Manny had spoken.   So, we actually believe that this is an 84 percent reduction in the sign.  So, you' re going from --  you' re really going to a postcard.   And real quick,  as we discussed,  people think signs are obsolete and that everyone uses the internet and the listing services. That is absolutely not true.   I have had multiple clients of mine that actually drive --  yeah,  even if I do a survey,  they' re still going to drive and make sure --  and there are properties that have signs.   And it' s mainly the small businesses that don' t know how to put their property on the internet,  on CoStar,  on LoopNet.   They' re the ones that rely on those signs more than any of them,  than any other business.   So, I think it' s very important.   And I'll tell you that the City of Coral Gables is already known to have the most stringent sign code of any municipality in Miami-Dade County and beyond.   We are in a competitive market right now.   We are fighting to make sure that we maintain as much occupancy of our buildings,  which is in the best interest of everyone,  including our --  and drive our economy and City revenue. And to take away any aspect of marketing a property,  in my mind, will result in the potential of a reduction there.   And then further,  unlike -as Manny had mentioned,  you would think residential is the same as commercial.   It's not true.  It is a completely different world of being a residential broker and a commercial broker.   And unlike\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential rental and sales signage that has worked with the postcard size, commercial real estate signs are materially more important to business and property owners.   And again,  most of these are small businesses. Many tenants and buyers actually,  as mentioned,  drive through the City. And so,  again,  I respectfully disagree that the proposed ordinance' s stated business impact of essentially limiting how many business users of these such real estate signs.  I do think it will hurt our economy,  have that potential to do so.   It is something that doesn' t just affect the real estate community. You have tenants that have space that need to sublease their space. It' s their responsibility to sublease their space. If they don' t sublease their space,  especially in a timely manner,  it can damage that business. So,  there are direct implications to the business impact in this.   So, I know we would, as a Chamber,  would like to have ample time to vet this, six months or whatever the appropriate time is, and then come back and then let' s see what the impact is and let' s have more edification on this before we move forward.   Thank you for your time and for hearing my comments.\n\nMayor Lago:   Thank you, sir.  Mr. Clerk.\n\nCity Clerk Urquia:  That' s it, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:   Anyone else in the Commission?\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   Yes, I…\n\nMayor Lago:   Yes, Madam Vice Mayor.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:   I just learned about this item really when it was published,  you know, to be able to actually take a look at the language.   Language does matter.   I don' t think there' s been adequate time to weigh the compliance requirements of the DBPR,  the Department of Business Professional Regulation.   I'm looking up some of it right now, versus the impact on the commercial real estate individuals who do this as a profession. But I do know from my experience dealing with commercial leases and entities that have to do the subleasing and so forth,  and my own experience going around and looking for commercial space,  I'm walking and looking for these signs and to have these little postage stamps on there,  especially when you' re talking about,  you know, requirements,  how many square feet, you know, am I even interested in looking at it, type of thing,  is a tremendous impact on the ability not only for practitioners to be able to do the marketing,  but also for the customers themselves.   Like, if I'm looking for new office space,  where am I going to go look?  I'm going to be walking in an area that I want to be in.  I'm very particular because I like to walk to my office.  So, you know, that' s how sensitive some of these issues are. Or you want to be near a different type of business because you don' t want to have too many restaurants next to each other.   You want to go walk that area and see how many restaurants are there.  Is there a clothing store there?  Is the clothing store wanting to be near the restaurant because the traffic that goes to the restaurant is going to be browsing then the clothing and going and buying that.   So,  the walkability of the area and the parking,  et cetera,  is a critical,  critical issue.   So,  I\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nrespectfully ask for\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The City of Coral Gables, referenced as having the most stringent sign code of any municipality in Miami-Dade County and beyond, involved in regulating signage impacting commercial real estate marketing and economic development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEACON COUNCIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Beacon Council, mentioned as an organization where a real estate professional has 10 years of experience as an officer related to economic development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, addressed by a speaker appreciating his intent to make the City Beautiful more beautiful.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANNY<|>PERSON<|>Manny, referenced as having spoken about differences between residential and commercial real estate signage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, during which discussions about commercial real estate signage and related ordinances took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAMBER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Chamber, representing business interests, requesting ample time (six months or appropriate) to vet the proposed ordinance regarding signage before moving forward.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding over the City Commission Meeting and acknowledging speakers and the City Clerk.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY CLERK URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Urquia, participating in the City Commission Meeting, responding to Mayor Lago.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, speaking at the City Commission Meeting about the timing and language of the proposed ordinance, emphasizing the importance of compliance with DBPR regulations and the impact on commercial real estate marketing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DBPR (DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL REGULATION)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Business Professional Regulation, referenced by Vice Mayor Anderson as a regulatory body whose compliance requirements are relevant to the proposed ordinance affecting commercial real estate signage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>ORDINANCE<|>A proposed ordinance discussed at the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, intended to limit commercial real estate signage size and quantity, potentially reducing marketing effectiveness and impacting small businesses and the local economy.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>The City of Coral Gables is the jurisdiction proposing the ordinance that regulates commercial real estate signage, as discussed in the meeting.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEACON COUNCIL<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES<|>The Beacon Council is referenced as an economic development organization connected to the City of Coral Gables through a real estate professional's experience.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES<|>Commissioner Fernandez is a member of the City Commission working to make the City Beautiful more beautiful.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANNY<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>Manny spoke about differences between residential and commercial signage relevant to the proposed ordinance.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHAMBER<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>The Chamber requests more time to vet the proposed ordinance before it moves forward, indicating direct involvement and concern.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>Mayor Lago presided over the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY CLERK URQUIA<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>City Clerk Urquia participated in the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>Vice Mayor Anderson spoke at the City Commission Meeting on January 9, 2024, about the proposed ordinance and its impacts.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>DBPR (DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL REGULATION)<|>Vice Mayor Anderson referenced the DBPR's compliance requirements in relation to the proposed ordinance.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROPOSED ORDINANCE<|>DBPR (DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL REGULATION)<|>The proposed ordinance must consider compliance requirements of the DBPR as noted by Vice Mayor Anderson.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
