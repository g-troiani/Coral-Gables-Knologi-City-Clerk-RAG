CONTEXT AND IDENTITY:**\n1.  **Strict Association**: When you extract an entity, its description and relationships MUST come from the immediate surrounding text ONLY.\n2.  **Detect Aliases and Identity**: If the text states or strongly implies that two different identifiers (e.g., \"Agenda Item E-1\" and \"Ordinance 2024-01\") refer to the SAME underlying legislative action, you MUST create a relationship between them.\n    *   **Action**: Create both entities (e.g., `AGENDA_ITEM:E-1` and `ORDINANCE:2024-01`).\n    *   **Relationship**: Link them with a relationship like `(\"relationship\"<|>E-1<|>2024-01<|>is the same legislative action<|>10)`.\n    *   **Description**: The descriptions for both entities should be consistent and reflect their shared identity.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

I was not exactly thrilled by our decorations on Miracle Mile this year.  I think we can do better.  I know that we did approve a budget for it. I know that there were issues with the timing and with storms and the lighting,  but I would like to see going forward and I did receive some complaints from residents about the decorations on Miracle Mile.  I would like to see this central avenue in our city be highlighted which ends at the Menorah that the Mayor purchased,  our Santa which is over 60 years old, and the park that we have every year and our Christmas Tree. I think it's important that Miracle Mile be highlighted going forward.  So that' s what I would like to see going forward,  it's just an improvement.  I know that we did in the past rely on the BID for some of this as well, but I think I would like to see an improvement.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago: Mr. Manager,  if I may. Belkys, you and I have talked on multiple occasions in regard to we received some emails and some kudos from business owners and people who have visited in regard to how much better the holiday decorations looked this year in comparison to past years, correct.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Yes.\n\nMayor Lago: Just to give a little bit of background,  because I know that two of the Commissioners were not here when this happened.  When the BID was basically removed from the picture,  we were in the process of working with them to come to an agreement and we had to scramble to pick up the pieces.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  We had two weeks to put it together.\n\nMayor Lago:  Two weeks.  Your team did a wonderful job,  along with the Manager.  This was basically like a dry run the first year. In regard to the Santa Clause,  you want to replace the Santa Clause.  I probably received five emails from people saying that the Santa Clause is historic and don' t touch my Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Who wants to replace it?\n\nMayor Lago:  I don' t know. I'm just telling you. You said something about the 60-year-old Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  No, I said leading up to it. We should make sure that the avenue leading to all of our historic decorations and the Menorah,  it needs to measure up, because…\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I thought you wanted to replace the Santa Clause.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  Not at all.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I just love him.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  There was a request to render it historic and to that point,  I think we need to do something to protect it, because it' s kind of just out in the open on a corner.  We need to make sure there' s something in front of it protecting it.\n\nMayor Lago:  Besides that. How much did we spend on the park in the last three years?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  On the park or on Miracle Mile?\n\nMayor Lago:  No, no. Miracle Mile is another thing. On the park.\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  I don' t know.\n\nCity Commission Meeting January 9, 2024\n\nMayor Lago:  I know it was a big investment.  Mr. Manager,  we hadn' t changed the decorations in decades,  correct.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  We changed it about three years ago and we are up on the new contract now.\n\nMayor Lago:  But what was the number,  it was massive.  We spent a lot of money.\n\nCity Manager Iglesias:  Mayor,  I think it was 250, 300, something like that…\n\nMayor Lago: We spent a lot of money on the park and obviously,  we' ve also spent,  how much did we spend on Miracle Mile so far?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez:  Miracle Mile and Giralda for the holiday decorations, 147,000 and my budget was $150,000.\n\nMayor Lago:  Did we buy these ornaments,  or these were just rented?\n\nEconomic Development Director Perez: There' s only a certain portion which was bought. Basically,  they were hand made for us, so the ornaments that are hanging from the trees and the ones that are on the median,  the stars that are on the median,  that is the only thing that we will continue with for the next three years.  So, two more years we' ve got of that. And then everything else,  so about $ 64,000, we have the ability to go out and we are going to go out to get bids for the rest of those decorations.  We did that because we, you know, I hear you Commissioner,  but I think\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY_OF_CORAL_GABLES_CITY_COMMISSION_MEETING<|>MEETING<|>City of Coral Gables City Commission Meeting held on January 9, 2024, at City Commission Chambers, 405 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, FL.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F-5<|>AGENDA_ITEM<|>Agenda Item F-5, discussed on January 9, 2024, concerning the Christmas decorations on Miracle Mile, sponsored by Commissioner Ariel Fernandez.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR_VINCE_LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Vince Lago, presiding officer of the City Commission during the meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE_MAYOR_RHONDA_ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Rhonda Anderson, member of the City Commission present at the meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER_MELISSA_CASTRO<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Melissa Castro, member of the City Commission present at the meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER_ARIEL_FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez, sponsor of Agenda Item F-5, member of the City Commission.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER_KIRK_MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Kirk Menendez, member of the City Commission present at the meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_ATTORNEY_CRISTINA_SUAREZ<|>PERSON<|>City Attorney Cristina Suárez, city staff member.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_PETER_IGLESIAS<|>PERSON<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias, city staff member involved in discussion about decorations and contracts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY_CLERK_BILLY_URQUIA<|>PERSON<|>City Clerk Billy Urquia, city staff member.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTOR_BELKYS_PEREZ<|>PERSON<|>Economic Development Director Belkys Perez, city staff member responsible for holiday decorations and budget details.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRACLE_MILE_CHRISTMAS_DECORATIONS_PROJECT<|>PROJECT<|>Project concerning the Christmas decorations on Miracle Mile, including lighting, ornaments, and related holiday decorations discussed under Agenda Item F-5.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLIDAY_DECORATIONS_BUDGET<|>MONEY<|>Budget allocated for holiday decorations on Miracle Mile and Giralda totaling $150,000, with $147,000 spent so far.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARK_DECORATIONS_INVESTMENT<|>MONEY<|>Investment in park decorations over the last three years, described as a large expenditure estimated around $250,000 to $300,000.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-5<|>MIRACLE_MILE_CHRISTMAS_DECORATIONS_PROJECT<|>Agenda Item F-5 is directly about the Miracle Mile Christmas decorations project, as stated in the discussion regarding the decorations on Miracle Mile sponsored by Commissioner Fernandez.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-5<|>COMMISSIONER_ARIEL_FERNANDEZ<|>Commissioner Ariel Fernandez is the sponsor of Agenda Item F-5, as explicitly stated in the text.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY_MANAGER_PETER_IGLESIAS<|>PARK_DECORATIONS_INVESTMENT<|>City Manager Peter Iglesias discussed the investment in park decorations over the last three years, indicating his involvement with the related contract and expenditures.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTOR_BELKYS_PEREZ<|>HOLIDAY_DECORATIONS_BUDGET<|>Economic Development Director Belkys Perez provided details about the holiday decorations budget and spending on Miracle Mile and Giralda.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_VINCE_LAGO<|>ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTOR_BELKYS_PEREZ<|>Mayor Lago and Economic Development Director Perez discussed the holiday decorations and related kudos from business owners and visitors.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_VINCE_LAGO<|>CITY_MANAGER_PETER_IGLESIAS<|>Mayor Lago engaged City Manager Iglesias in discussion about park decoration investments and contracts.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYOR_VINCE_LAGO<|>F-5<|>Mayor Lago referenced moving onto Agenda Item F-5 and participated actively in the discussion.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICE_MAYOR_RHONDA_ANDERSON<|>F-5<|>Vice Mayor Anderson participated in the discussion of Agenda Item F-5, specifically about the Santa Claus decoration.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER_ARIEL_FERNANDEZ<|>MIRACLE_MILE_CHRISTMAS_DECORATIONS_PROJECT<|>Commissioner Fernandez expressed opinions and requests regarding the Miracle Mile Christmas decorations project.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIRACLE_MILE_CHRISTMAS_DECORATIONS_PROJECT<|>HOLIDAY_DECORATIONS_BUDGET<|>The Miracle Mile Christmas decorations project is funded by the holiday decorations budget of $150,000, with $147,000 spent so far.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
