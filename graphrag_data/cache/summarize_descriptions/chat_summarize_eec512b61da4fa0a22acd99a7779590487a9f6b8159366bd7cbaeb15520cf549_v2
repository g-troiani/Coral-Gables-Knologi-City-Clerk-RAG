It plays a crucial role in enhancing transit accessibility by connecting important locations such as Homestead, Florida International University (FIU), Miami-Dade College, Miami Beach, and the Miami International Airport. Despite its significance, the Metrorail system has been noted to have certain inadequacies when compared to transit systems serving major airports in cities like Atlanta, New York, and Washington, DC. In Coral Gables, Metrorail is an integral part of the transportation network, contributing to efforts aimed at reducing parking demand and improving overall affordability for commuters.
