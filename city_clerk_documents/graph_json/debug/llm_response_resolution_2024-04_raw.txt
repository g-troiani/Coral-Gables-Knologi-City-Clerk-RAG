Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to find the agenda item code from the provided resolution document. The instructions are clear: I need to look through the entire document and extract only the code in the specified format. 

First, I'll start by reading through the entire document text carefully. The document is split into two pages. Let me go through each part step by step.

Starting with Page 1: It's the main body of the resolution, talking about approving an inventory list for affordable housing. There are several "WHEREAS" clauses and sections, but I don't see any mention of an agenda item code here. The document number is 2024-04, but that's the resolution number, not the agenda item.

Moving to Page 2: Here, after the sections, there's a part where it mentions the vote results: "Yeas: Castro, Fernandez, Menendez, Anderson, Lago) Unanimous: 5-0Vote)". Then, right after that, there's a line that says "AgendaItem: E-9)". 

Ah, here it is! The line "AgendaItem: E-9)" clearly states the agenda item code. The format matches the examples given, like E-9. The user specified to return only the code, so I should extract "E-9". 

I need to make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. Scanning again through the document, the rest includes the attestation by the Mayor, City Clerk, and City Attorney, but nothing else about the agenda item. 

The code is written as "E-9" with a closing parenthesis, but according to the examples, the code should be just the letters and numbers. So "E-9" is correct. The user wants it in the format AGENDA_ITEM: [code], so the answer should be AGENDA_ITEM: E-9. 

No other codes are present. The example codes had hyphens, so the hyphen in E-9 is appropriate. I don't see any other possible codes here. Definitely, that's the one.
