However, the detailed nature of the mandated language often presents challenges, particularly when applied to smaller signs, as it can be difficult to fit all the required information within limited space. Overall, the DBPR plays a crucial role in regulating commercial real estate signage to maintain transparency and compliance within the industry.\",3\n1035,SIGNAGE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT,\"The required language mandated by the DBPR to be displayed on for sale, for lease, or for rent signage, which complicates fitting all information on small signs.\",1\n309,CITY FACILITIES ENUMERATED,\"A list of city facilities that the City Commission may establish or modify by resolution and operate without regard to zoning or use classification, including public parks, fire stations, police stations, water and sewer facilities, libraries, auditoriums, arenas, museums, art galleries, convention halls, solid-waste facilities, maintenance yards, and bus stations.\",1\n494,2023 LEGISLATIVE SESSION,The 2023 legislative session of the Florida Legislature during which Chapter Law 2023-017 (Live Local Act) was enacted.,1\n845,PARKING PEDESTALS,\"Parking pedestals refer to parking structures that impact the height and scale of developments in Coral Gables by consuming building square footage, relevant to zoning considerations under the Live Local Act.\",1\n861,PARCEL SIZE,\"PARCEL SIZE is a key factor in determining the amount of parking reduction allowed under the Urban Center Program. The program categorizes parcels into three size groups: less than 15,000 square feet, between 15,000 and 30,000 square feet, and greater than 30,000 square feet. Smaller parcels, those under 15,000 square feet, are eligible for larger parking reductions, while larger parcels, particularly those exceeding 30,000 square feet, qualify for smaller reductions. This tiered approach ensures that parking requirements are adjusted based on the size of the parcel, promoting efficient land use and accommodating varying development scales within urban centers.\",2\n886,PARKING REDUCTION TIERS,Tiered parking reduction system from the Urban Center Program offering reductions from 10% up to 100% based on proximity to transit and parcel
