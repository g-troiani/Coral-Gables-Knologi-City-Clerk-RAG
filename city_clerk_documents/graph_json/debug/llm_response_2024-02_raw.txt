Okay, I need to find the agenda item code in this document. The user said it can be anywhere, so I have to check the entire text. Let me start skimming through the provided text.

Looking at the beginning, the document is Ordinance No. 2024-02. The main body talks about amending various sections. The WHEREAS clauses and the sections. Then there's a part at the end of page 2 or 3 maybe. Let me look for keywords like "Agenda item" or "item" followed by a code like E-2 or similar.

Lookinging through page 1 and 2, there's a lot of sections being amended. Then on the third page, after the sections, there's a part where it says "PASSED ANDADOPTED THISNINTHDAYOFJANUARY, A.D., 2024." Then "Moved: Anderson / Seconded: Fernandez) Yeas: ... Unanimous: 5-0Vote) AgendaItem: E-2) APPROVED:..." 

Ah there it is! The line says "AgendaItem: E-2)" exactly. So the code is E-2. I need to make sure there's no other codes elsewhere. Let me check the rest of the document quickly. The rest are sections and exhibits, so I think that's the only one. So the answer should be E-2.

AGENDA_ITEM: E-2
