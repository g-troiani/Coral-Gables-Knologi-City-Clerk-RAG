This chapter outlines the procedures and standards for disseminating legal notices, traditionally through newspapers, to ensure public awareness and transparency. Recently, Chapter 50 was amended by House Bill 7049 (HB 7049), which introduced significant changes to these requirements. The amendment allows for the publication of legal notices not only in newspapers but also on publicly accessible websites, reflecting a modernization of the notice process to accommodate digital platforms. This change aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in the dissemination of legal information. Chapter 50, as amended by HB 7049, is also referenced in local regulations such as Ordinance 2024-03, indicating its applicability and integration into municipal legal frameworks.
