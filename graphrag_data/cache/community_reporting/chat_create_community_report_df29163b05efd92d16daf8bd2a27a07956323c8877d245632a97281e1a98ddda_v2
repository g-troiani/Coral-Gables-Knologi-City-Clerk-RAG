TERESA SCHOOL,\"St. Teresa School is a local educational institution recognized as part of the community impacted by decisions discussed in a recent meeting. Unlike another nearby school property that has been causing parking issues in the neighborhood, St. Teresa School is noted for having adequate parking facilities. This distinction highlights St. Teresa School’s ability to manage its parking needs effectively, thereby minimizing disruption to the surrounding community. Overall, St. Teresa School plays an integral role in the local area, both as an educational establishment and as a well-managed property in terms of parking and neighborhood impact.\",2\n39,SCHOOL,\"The SCHOOL is a nonprofit educational institution operating on the property since 2001, currently serving approximately 180 students, including Pre-K 3 and Pre-K 4 classrooms. It functions actively for 172 days each year and has been involved in significant property developments, including a building demolition and replacement project. The school is subject to enrollment limitations and legal covenants, requiring the submission of annual affidavits to verify student enrollment numbers. \n\nSince purchasing the property in 2016, the SCHOOL has held an educational exemption but faces challenges related to limited parking availability, which has led to neighborhood concerns and discussions involving the City Commission and local residents. To address these issues, the SCHOOL actively communicates with parents through monthly newsletters, emphasizing parking rules and specifically discouraging parking on swales to minimize neighborhood disruption. \n\nThe SCHOOL is also engaged in ongoing site planning efforts, including a master site plan process dating back to 2000, with representation by Ms. Russo. These efforts focus on balancing the school’s operational needs with neighborhood impact and compliance with property use restrictions. The SCHOOL’s proactive involvement in the site plan amendment process and its open communication with the community demonstrate its commitment to maintaining a positive relationship with neighbors while continuing to provide educational services.\",28\n148,SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES,\"Single-family homes in the neighborhood are being purchased and converted into school space, a process that has raised concerns among residents regarding parking availability and the overall impact on the neighborhood. These residential properties are often demolished or taken down to accommodate the expansion of school facilities and to create additional parking solutions.

In the context of the school and neighborhood, parking arrangements include designated coned-off spaces specifically for drop-off purposes, which help manage traffic flow and ensure safety. However, there are concerns about parking on swales—areas typically designed for drainage or landscaping—which can lead to environmental and maintenance issues.\n\nFrom a commercial real estate perspective, parking is a critical factor influencing property value and usability. Manny Chamizo highlights the importance of parking availability when evaluating commercial properties, as it directly impacts customer access and convenience. Additionally, the placement of signage is closely tied to parking considerations; improperly parked vehicles can obstruct the visibility of commercial signs, thereby reducing business exposure and potentially affecting revenue.\n\nOverall, parking plays a multifaceted role, affecting school operations, neighborhood dynamics, commercial real estate decisions, and business marketing effectiveness. Proper management and thoughtful planning of parking spaces are essential to address safety, environmental concerns, and economic factors in these interconnected contexts.\",10\n244,NEIGHBORHOOD RESOLUTION,A proposed resolution or agreement between the school and neighbors to address parking and related neighborhood issues near Salvadore Park,5\n153,CORAL GABLES SCHOOLS,\"Schools in Coral Gables mentioned as comparison points that have adequate parking, unlike the school property causing neighborhood issues\",1\n154,PONCE SCHOOLS,\"Schools in Ponce mentioned as comparison points that have adequate parking, unlike the school property causing neighborhood issues\",1\n146,NEIGHBORS,\"The neighbors living behind and around the school property and Salvadore Park are actively involved in landscaping efforts and have raised concerns regarding traffic and parking problems in the area.
