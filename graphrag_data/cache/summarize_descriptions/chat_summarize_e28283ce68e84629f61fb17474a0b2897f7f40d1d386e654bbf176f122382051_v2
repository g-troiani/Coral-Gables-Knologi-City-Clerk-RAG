This ordinance amends multiple sections of the City Code, including Section 62-331 (Adoption of Ordinance), Section 78-281 (Requirement for Underground Utilities), Section 101-109 (Notices), Section 109-41 (Permit Application Procedures - Class 1 Permits), and Section 109-42 (Permit Application Procedures - Class 2 Permits). The primary purpose of these amendments is to provide a clear definition of \"publication\" and to remove the longstanding requirement for legal notices to be published in newspapers.\n\nThe changes enacted by Ordinance 2024-02 align with the 2022 State Legislature’s adoption of House Bill 7049, which updated legal notice requirements under Florida Statute 50.0311. Specifically, the ordinance authorizes the City of Coral Gables to publish legal notices on a publicly accessible website rather than in traditional newspapers. This shift aims to increase accessibility for residents and achieve cost savings for the City by leveraging digital platforms for legal notifications.\n\nIn addition to the substantive amendments, the ordinance includes standard provisions such as a repealer clause, a severability clause to ensure the remainder of the ordinance remains effective if any part is invalidated, codification instructions, and an effective date. The ordinance’s effective date follows the statutory allowance for online publication beginning January 1, 2023.\n\nTo facilitate the transition from newspaper to online publication, the City has planned an education campaign to inform residents about the new method of accessing legal notices. This initiative underscores the City’s commitment to transparency and public awareness while embracing modern, cost-efficient communication methods.\n\nOverall, Ordinance 2024-02 represents a significant update to the City of Coral Gables’ legal notice procedures, reflecting state legislative changes and modernizing the City’s approach to public notifications by moving from print to digital publication.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749840828, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 515, "total_tokens": 925, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
