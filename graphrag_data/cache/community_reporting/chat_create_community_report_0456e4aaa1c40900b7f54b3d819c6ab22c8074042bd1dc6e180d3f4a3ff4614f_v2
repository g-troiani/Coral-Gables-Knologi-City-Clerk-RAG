This section regulates the undergrounding of utility and communication installations within the city. It establishes requirements for new construction, rehabilitation projects, and the conversion of existing overhead utility and communication facilities to underground installations. The purpose of Section 78-281 is to promote the conversion of overhead utility and communication services to underground systems in order to enhance reliability, public safety, aesthetics, and continuity of service. The regulations apply broadly to all utility lines, with the exception of certain transmission lines and utility lines and poles installed by the city itself.
