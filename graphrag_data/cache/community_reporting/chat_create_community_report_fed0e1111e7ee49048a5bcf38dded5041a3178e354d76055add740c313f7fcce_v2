It connects directly to all other entities, including ALLEGED VIOLATORS, MANAGERS OF COMMERCIAL PREMISES, NOTICE OF VIOLATION, and SUMMONS FOR HEARING, highlighting its pivotal role in the enforcement process. This centrality indicates that the community is structured around the issuance and delivery of these notices, which are critical for maintaining regulatory compliance and legal due process. The high degree of NOTICES (8) compared to other entities further supports its central role [Data: Entities (213, 220, 224, 233, 234); Relationships (254, 258, 259, 260, 261)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Multiple delivery methods ensure notice receipt\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The community employs various methods to deliver notices of violation and summonses, including certified mail, hand delivery, leaving notices at residences, or leaving them with managers of commercial premises. This multi-modal delivery approach increases the likelihood that alleged violators receive their notices, which is essential for legal compliance and procedural fairness. Certified mail is specifically highlighted as a key delivery method, linking NOTICES to official address records or those provided by violators themselves. The inclusion of managers of commercial premises as recipients when direct delivery is not possible further demonstrates the system's robustness in ensuring notice delivery [Data: Relationships (254, 258, 259)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"ALLEGED VIOLATOR as the primary recipient of enforcement actions\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The ALLEGED VIOLATOR entity represents the individuals or organizations accused of regulatory violations. They are the primary recipients of notices of violation and summonses for hearings, making them central to the enforcement process. The responsibility placed on alleged violators to keep their address information current underscores the importance of accurate communication channels in the regulatory framework. The relatively low degree (1) of ALLEGED VIOLATOR compared to NOTICES suggests that while they are numerous or varied, the enforcement process is centralized through the notices system [Data: Entities (220); Relationships (258)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Role of MANAGER OF COMMERCIAL PREMISES in notice delivery\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Managers of commercial premises act as alternative recipients for notices when direct delivery to alleged violators is not feasible.

Both are subsets of the broader NOTICES entity and are delivered to alleged violators to inform them of regulatory breaches and to summon them for hearings, respectively. This categorization reflects a structured legal process that separates notification of alleged infractions from the procedural step of summoning for adjudication.
