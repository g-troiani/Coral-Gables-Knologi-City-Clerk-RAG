I'll give you a little bit of background.   St. Philip' s has been in the City of Coral Gables as a church for 80 years.   The school has been in existence for 70 years.   For those of you who don' t know the exact location,  it is located on the block that is bounded by Coral Way to the north, Andalusia to the south,  Columbus to the west,  and Cordova to the east. Back in 2001 through 2003,  St. Philip' s underwent a master plan process.   And in that process,  it was proposing a new building,  but during that process,  it underwent a total review of its operations.   Conditions were imposed,  limiting the number of students,  setting up the drop-off operation,  legislating certain landscaping,  making sure that any changes to a site plan would go before a public hearing process, making decisions with respect to colors of the building so that the school would blend into the\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nresidential neighborhood,
