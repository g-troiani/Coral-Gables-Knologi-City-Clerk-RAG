C. Toyos.\n\nMayor Lago:   Mr. Toyos.  Good morning.\n\nJ. C. Toyos:  Good morning,  J. C. Toyos,  1044 Coral Way.\n\nWaldo Toyos:   Waldo Toyos, 1044 Coral Way.\n\nMs. Toyos:   And we' re here to speak against what they' re talking about.   I mean,  I'm shocked at the fact that you decided not to do what the Planning and Zoning Committee recommended in order to help the problems that we' re having with parking.   But aside from that,  we had sent an email to you guys because we have, looking into this issue,  found some other issues that we' d like to address that are important not just to me and my family, but to our community as a whole.  First, we would have really appreciated for them to reach out to us to let us know that they were no longer planning on doing what they said they were going to do.   So, it was kind of shocking for me to hear now that what they --  we thought were going to do as far as the parking situation to help alleviate it,  they' re not even going to do that.  And I've also been a part of the community for over 30 some odd years,  and he was born here.   So,  he also went to Salvadore Park,  and he was also coming to the area,  and we also have five children that are -  that were raised there.   So,  we know the community really well.   So,  this is also our family that is being impacted,  not just by what they' re planning on doing, but their future families,  if God bless,  they decide to stay in Coral Gables.   So, the first thing is the landscape.   I can' t believe you guys backed out of that.   I think it' s unconscionable to do so.  I do think that the reason that we' re having parking issues is because of the parents in the school.   And the reason for that is because it' s during the time periods that you guys are picking up your children and the children are being dropped off.  So, I do think it's a responsibility that the school bears,  and I do think that you guys should take care of it.  Second, what we found during some research is that the school' s growing.   They' re saying that they' re capped,  and they' re saying that they' re keeping their covenant. I couldn' t find the covenant to review it.   So, I haven' tâ€¦\n\nMs. Russo:   I have a copy.  The covenant is recorded in the public records of Miami- Dade County.\n\nMs. Toyos:  They' re growing.   And not only are they growing by square footage,  they' re growing in acquiring homes right across from my house.   They bought the house right across from us, and they' re using it for their school activities.   So,  I think that the covenant has been broken,  simply because if they were originally just going to be a school with their original homes and the original\n\nCity Commission\n\nMeeting\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 2024\n\nsquare footage that they have,  their square footage is already grown with the new addition and changes they' ve made.   And if you look at the plot lines of the lots, they' ve encroached on them. In other words,  one lot encroaches on another lot, and then they expand on that classroom.   And then when they bought the house across the street from us, I don' t know what you guys are using it for, I'd like to know because they do have a lot of activity going on in there,  and a lot of kids and parents coming in and out.  So, there are questions that were brought to my mind that weren' t there before because of this issue.   And if they are going to make an amendment to the covenant, I would like some things changed to that covenant going forward in order for this to be approved. Okay, baby, your turn.\n\nMr. Toyos:   I think that,  how do you call it, first of all, this thing about the --  what the Planning and Zoning Board,  it wasn' t us who asked for the swale improvement. It was the Planning and Zoning Board that said,  hey, you, you guys, this is on you.   It wasn' t us asking the Planning and Zoning Board.   We just went up there and,  how do you call it, said we have a traffic problem. They' re blocking our driveways.   Yeah,  I mean,  and this happens,  how do you call it, constantly. And I keep on hearing it's the Salvadore Park, people who come to Salvadore Park,  the dog park, the pickleballers.   I don' t see people with pickleball rackets coming down, you know, blocking our driveways or doing that.  We' re trying to just keep our swales like any normal one.  Yes, we have normal use of swale,  delivery guys,  postal service,  whatever. But at least with that,  we could maintain our grass.   We can' t maintain our grass.   Their side looks like a desert,  okay, on Cordova side.\n\nMs. Toyos:  ( INAUDIBLE)  the pictures?\n\nMr.  Toyos: One of our neighbors behind them has had his swale with,  how do you call it, landscaping\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>J.
