Firstly, it authorizes the vacation of a twenty-foot wide public alleyway in Coral Gables in accordance with applicable zoning and city codes. Additionally, the ordinance amends Article 11, Section 11-107 of the City of Coral Gables zoning code to establish regulations for signs related to real estate sales, leases, or rentals across all use districts, ensuring consistent and controlled signage practices throughout the city. Furthermore, the ordinance modifies the Future Land Use Map and zoning district boundaries by changing the land use designation of certain specified lots from Commercial Low-Rise Intensity to Commercial High-Rise Intensity. Correspondingly, it rezones these lots from Mixed-Use 1 to Mixed-Use 3, reflecting a shift toward higher density and intensity of commercial development. Collectively, these legislative measures demonstrate the City Commissionâ€™s efforts to manage urban development, land use, and visual regulations in Coral Gables comprehensively.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749145736, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 496, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
