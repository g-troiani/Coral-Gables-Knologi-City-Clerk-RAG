Effective July 1, 2023, the Act mandates local governments to amend zoning codes, particularly by allowing reductions in parking requirements for affordable housing projects situated near transit, thereby easing development standards. It also authorizes the development of affordable housing units under these revised standards, representing a significant state-level intervention to promote housing affordability and transit-oriented development. This Act is directly linked to other entities such as height and density limitations, mixed-use districts, and transit improvements, underscoring its central role in shaping local urban policy [Data: Entities (1100, 1109, 1211); Relationships (1705, 1878, 1881, 1882, 1776)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Preemption of local height and density limitations\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Live Local Act preempts existing local zoning restrictions in Coral Gables, specifically height and density limitations, to facilitate affordable housing development.

Regarding density, the Act requires a citywide analysis but effectively overrides the maximum density of 125 units per acre, enabling potentially higher density affordable housing projects. These preemptions are critical as they remove local barriers that could otherwise restrict the scale and feasibility of affordable housing developments, aligning local zoning with state affordable housing goals [Data: Entities (1215, 1216); Relationships (1881, 1882); Entities (1100)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Focus on mixed-use districts MX1, MX2, and MX3 for affordable housing\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The mixed-use districts MX1, MX2, and MX3 in Coral Gables are targeted zones where the Live Local Act’s provisions apply.
