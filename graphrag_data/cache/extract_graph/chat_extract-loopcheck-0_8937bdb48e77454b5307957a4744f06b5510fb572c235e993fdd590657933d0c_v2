Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- title: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- type: One of the following types: [agenda_item,ordinance,resolution,document_number,cross_reference,person,organization,meeting,money,project]\n- description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, **based ONLY on the immediate context and aliasing rules**.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><title><|><type><|><description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other in the immediate text.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other, **citing direct evidence from the text**.\n- weight: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source><|><target><|><description><|><weight>)\n\n3.

Show the next one please. And then we have other streetlights.  And these other streetlights are generally with the exception of the one in the middle,  and that also happens there too,  are generally a private development,  but they are on city right-of-way.  Why doesn' t the city say hey, we' ve got a brand here, use our streetlights.  You get to put it in, you get to pay for it, but please use ours,  and you can use our great Denman Fink lights if you wish.  Go to the next one please.  We have the one in the middle is about four of them and they are over at the French Village on Hardee.  The one here,  let' s see,  on your right is all throughout the northeastern apartment district,  and they' ve been there since close to dirt, because I remember them there over 40 years ago.  And then the one over here that you see on the far left, that' s the Highway Department and that' s on 8th,  Calle Ocho.  And then if you go to Bird Road,  the Highway Department has another one entirely which we don' t have a picture.  I could go on and on and on. We' ve got lots of these things. But the really cool thing is, when you walk it, when you cross that line from wherever it is, from Dade County or the City of Miami or South Miami, and you come here to this special place, its street jewelry embraces you.  If you would go to the next,  please.  We have a new monument that we' ve put in. We' ve put in the black lights,  nobody really thought about that.  And then we have these other kind of street poles I really like. Those are the ones that should be fixed and there' s quite a few like those ones without hats or ones that are broken,  or they are severely tilted over.  So,  if you would please.  So really,  this is not just about history,  it' s about brand and urban design.  It' s about how we want our city to be and we' re going to talk about this a little bit further, and I highly recommend to the board and I will do it again when I read the resolution that we take a look at this and we do it in a deliberate way, that we take this opportunity to not only continue to brand and make our city great, but also to come up with standards that make it easy for us to not only identify where we are in the community.  No other city, no other area in South Florida has streetlights like we do,  nor the color that we have.  We are unique.  So,  with that I'd really recommend considering this and I look forward to speaking with you again about this issue shortly.\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nJanuary 9, 2024\n\nThank you very much for your attention and thank you for anything.  If you have a question,  I'm happy to answer.\n\nMayor Lago:  I just wanted to say thank you for putting that together.  It took a lot of work. I know you take your time to really make sure you drove home the point of the importance of restoring and reviving our history.  I think we are going to go over it a few times. I think there are two items on the Commission that we' ll hear together that address this issue and I welcome you to come back again.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nMayor Lago:  I think you' ll notice also from the Commission;  I think we are all on the same page in regard to what we want to see. I just think that we need to bring FPL, which is my understanding that FPL will be attending the next Commission meeting to have a conversation in regard to what can we do to get a little bit of uniformity as we address lights moving forward.  You brought up something that I hadn' t thought about, I think is a great idea is the issue,  as developers continue to build throughout this community in one form or another or we invest in this community,  there should be uniformity on that front,  even if it' s something that' s existing,  we should like we' re doing with the White Way Lights.  We just got back ten,  I was there the other day when they brought them in, and we' re going to get about another eight that are in really good shape that are actually working.  So those again will be refurbished,  and they' ll be put somewhere prominently wherever the Historic Preservation and the Manager deem appropriate, and I think that' s something in the works that shows our commitment.  Now the issue is the standard lights that we really need to focus on and see how we can achieve the goal because the costs are pretty significant.\n\nMr. Maxwell:  Mayor,  one of the things that I really enjoy about FPL and I do enjoy FPL, I think it' s a wonderful company and they' ve really proven that they are good community citizens,  but you know I want to bring your attention back to a few years ago when FPL said that it was going to cost $30,000 a house to underground,  and how in recent past, not too long ago, its now not going to cost anything.  So, you know, these things have a way of not only working themselves out, but to the benefit of the entire community making it better.\n\nCity Commission Meeting Mayor Lago:  I think to your point,  and you bring a very good point.  I worked with the Manager for years meeting with the President of\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CORAL GABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The municipal government entity responsible for the City of Coral Gables, overseeing urban design, streetlight standards, and community branding efforts as discussed in the meeting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DENMAN FINK LIGHTS<|>PROJECT<|>A specific style of streetlights referenced as a brand element for the City of Coral Gables, recommended for use on city right-of-way and private developments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH VILLAGE<|>PROJECT<|>A location in Coral Gables where about four streetlights of a particular style are installed on Hardee, mentioned as part of the city's streetlight inventory.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTHEASTERN APARTMENT DISTRICT<|>PROJECT<|>A district in Coral Gables where a certain style of streetlights has been present for over 40 years, indicating long-standing urban design elements.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT LIGHTS<|>PROJECT<|>Streetlights managed or installed by the Highway Department, located on 8th, Calle Ocho, and Bird Road, noted as part of the city's streetlight landscape.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK LIGHTS MONUMENT<|>PROJECT<|>A new monument installed featuring black lights, representing a recent addition to the city's streetlight and urban design features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING JANUARY 9, 2024<|>MEETING<|>A City Commission meeting held on January 9, 2024, where discussions about streetlight branding, urban design, and collaboration with FPL took place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>The Mayor of Coral Gables who acknowledged the importance of restoring and reviving the city's history, supported uniformity in streetlight design, and mentioned upcoming discussions with FPL.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
