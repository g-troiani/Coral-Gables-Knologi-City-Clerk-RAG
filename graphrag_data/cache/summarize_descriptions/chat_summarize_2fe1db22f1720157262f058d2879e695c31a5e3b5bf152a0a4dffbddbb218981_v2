It establishes criteria for determining the validity of absentee ballots, guided by advisory input from the city attorney and a representative of the county supervisor of elections. During the canvassing process, the board reviews absentee ballot envelopes, marking those deemed invalid with the notation \"REJECTED AS ILLEGAL.\" Valid ballots are separated from their secrecy envelopes and prepared for counting.\n\nThe board records the number of valid and invalid ballots on a certificate, which is signed by all members. Absentee votes are counted publicly after 7:00 p.m. on election day, and the board certifies the election results immediately following the count. In the event a recount is required, the board is responsible for certifying the recount results within two days after the election.\n\nFollowing certification by the Canvassing Board, the city commission adopts a resolution accepting the certified results at its first regular meeting after any run-off election.
