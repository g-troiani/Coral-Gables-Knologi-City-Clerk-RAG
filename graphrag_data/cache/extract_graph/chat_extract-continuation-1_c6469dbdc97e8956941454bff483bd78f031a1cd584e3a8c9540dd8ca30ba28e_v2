Does that opportunity work for you?\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  That' s definitely one option.  I know we discussed that when this first came up.  Other than presentations and obviously the recognition,  Employee of the Month,  its September so we' re recognizing, is there a way to manage how many protocol items are per Commission meeting?  Can we cap it a little bit better because if you look at it, there are months\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\nthat we have an hour-and-a-half, two hours, and then there are other meetings that we have, we' re done in 40 minutes or 35 minutes.  Is there a way to manage what comes before us?\n\nHR Director Elejabarrieta:  There could be. From the employee perspective,  there' s not that many employees that we recognize.  Its an Employee of the Month,  at least from the general employees, right.  So that' s one employee per month,  not including Police and Fire that are recognized every month.  What we tend to do is, we usually save -  so right now we' re in the process of selecting our November,  December and January employees and we are going to bring them before you in February.  So, we usually do about three general employees per Commission meeting every four or five Commission meetings.  As to the protocols,  that all depends.  A lot of the protocols are directed by you all, right.  It' s Disability Awareness Month,  Alzheimer' s Month,  there' s a lot of different types of protocols that HR doesn' t manage,  that usually comes out of one of your offices or one of the different department' s offices.  Can we cap it?  We can cap it, but thenâ€¦\n\nCommissioner Menendez:  I have a suggestion.  Can we identify,  just brainstorming,  identify those items that can go in the morning and perhaps have the other ones maybe at noon, split it so that we can start the day getting to work and getting to business.  Have particular identify which ones would be the morning protocols and then at 12 or 12:30 we stop for 30 minutes to do, that way at least we get the day rolling. Otherwise,  we' re all here happy to recognize,  but it really delays the ability to move the agenda.\n\nMayor Lago:  I would support that.\n\nVice Mayor Anderson:  I also have another suggestion as well. We' ve been utilizing it and that is these time certain items. For instance,  the time that there was an 11 o' clock time certain, we paused for a moment,  because it was already 11:15, and I understand that Commissioner Fernandez was presenting at the time,  but we paused for a moment so we could take a speaker who is a businessperson, a resident of our community and allow them to speak.  So,  we as a Commission can better organize our Commission agenda by having time certains for things that people do want to come here and speak on, other than the general time that we have for public comment.  We could even put the general time for public comment as a time certain as well, so people know what time they can come in for the general public comment.  It's just a matter of scheduling.  I deal with schedules every single day when I'm dealing with courts and various people come in and any time that you ignore the overwhelming desire of the Police and Fire people to be recognized in a general meeting where everybody is there,  as opposed to just a resident showing up. And I'm not talking about whether or not this Commission shows up. I'm talking about whether residents are seeing what' s going on, then it is a second- class designation that you give to somebody when they are not in a general meeting itself,  because that' s the purpose here,  to recognize.  You don' t recognize somebody by not including them.\n\nCommissioner Fernandez:  I think second class is also stating an 11 a.m. time certain,  not taking the item until 11:57. Like we did today to give preference to another item, because we had folks from the Chamber here.  We' re bordering on just choosing who we want to select as first class\n\nCity Commission Meeting\n\ncitizens when we are saying,  we' re going to stop the discussion on this item which everybody was listening to and we had members in the room who were here to speak on the item,  residents, because we had one person who we wanted to discuss one item on and we decided to take that item first. Again, I'm happy moving forward with this. I do not believe that any employee is going to tell you that they believe they' re second class citizens,  because we' re doing a special ceremony to recognize them and I'm happy to make a motion to move this forward.\n\nMayor Lago:  Before you make your motion.  I think also what you' re not recognizing is that you mentioned that we' re not following the schedule,  we' re not keeping time certain.  We had one item that was time certain today, and the conversation ran long in regard to the school,  but let' s be also very clear. We' re also incredibly lenient, incredibly lenient on the time that we give to all residents that speak. The gentleman who spoke not once,  but two times on the same issue, which is something that we don' t have to do, spoke for probably twelve minutes,  because I was looking\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MEETING<|>A City Commission Meeting of Coral Gables where discussions about managing protocol items, employee recognitions, and scheduling time certain items took place, involving Commissioners Menendez, Fernandez, Mayor Lago, Vice Mayor Anderson, and HR Director Elejabarrieta.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Menendez, a member of the City Commission, who suggested managing the number of protocol items per meeting and splitting protocol items between morning and noon to improve meeting efficiency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HR DIRECTOR ELEJABARRIETA<|>PERSON<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta, who explained the employee recognition process, including Employee of the Month recognitions for general employees, Police, and Fire, and noted that many protocols come from various offices and departments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH<|>PROJECT<|>Employee of the Month recognition program, recognizing one general employee per month, excluding Police and Fire employees who are recognized monthly, with presentations typically grouped every few Commission meetings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>PERSON<|>Commissioner Fernandez, a member of the City Commission, who discussed concerns about scheduling time certain items and the perception of prioritizing some speakers over others during meetings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>PERSON<|>Mayor Lago, presiding officer of the City Commission Meeting, who supported suggestions to improve meeting scheduling and emphasized leniency in allowing residents to speak.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>PERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson, a member of the City Commission, who suggested using time certain items to better organize the agenda and ensure recognition of Police and Fire employees in general meetings.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>Commissioner Menendez participated in the City Commission Meeting discussing protocol item management and scheduling.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>HR DIRECTOR ELEJABARRIETA<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta provided information about employee recognition during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>COMMISSIONER FERNANDEZ<|>Commissioner Fernandez spoke about time certain scheduling and meeting priorities at the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>MAYOR LAGO<|>Mayor Lago presided over and contributed to discussions at the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY COMMISSION MEETING<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>Vice Mayor Anderson suggested agenda organization improvements during the City Commission Meeting.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMISSIONER MENENDEZ<|>EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH<|>Commissioner Menendez referenced the Employee of the Month recognition program in the context of managing protocol items.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HR DIRECTOR ELEJABARRIETA<|>EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH<|>HR Director Elejabarrieta described the Employee of the Month recognition process and scheduling.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICE MAYOR ANDERSON<|>POLICE AND FIRE RECOGNITION<|>Vice Mayor Anderson emphasized the importance of recognizing Police and Fire employees in general meetings, as part of protocol items.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
